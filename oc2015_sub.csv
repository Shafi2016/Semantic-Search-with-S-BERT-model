2015-01-01,Danielle Goldfarb: Five trade trends for 2015 and how Canada can take advantage of them,"despite challenges in the global economy, in 2015, there will be important opportunities available for canada to grow its international trade. the federal government is opening doors to new markets including the european union and korea. with expertise, products, and resources that are in demand in global markets, canadian companies can position themselves to step through those doors. we have identified 5 trade trends for 2015, based on conference board of canada research by the .five of canada s top 10 fastest growing exports over the past decade have been services. canadian leaders need to think beyond selling physical products and resources and consider ways to sell our services and expertise directly into other markets. for businesses, a face - to - face presence with clients is needed, with a deeper engagement than simply a shipping label. for policy - makers, that means paying more attention to moving people and the importance of companies setting up a local presence in global markets. thus, issues such as access to direct flights and visa requirements are becoming more important than they have been in the past.over the past decade canada s exports to the you.s. have flat - lined. exporters have traditionally focused mainly on the you.s., even though canada is losing market share there, mainly to china and other emerging markets. the you.s. will remain canada s most important future market, but companies have to look for growth elsewhere. face long - term and serious energy, water, and food challenges. canada has expertise and products or technologies in all of these areas. for instance, food products are canada s second fastest - growing export. in areas such as consumer products, canada can take advantage of the growing middle class in emerging economies for services and higher - end products. for example, canada is now brazil s fourth - largest source of cosmetic imports, and malaysia s fifth - largest source of pet food imports.the gap between high - performing canadian companies and weak performers in global markets is significant, and it is extremely wide in emerging markets in particular. our shows clearly that constant innovation is critical to sustaining a presence in international markets. constant innovation is one of the key ways to protect companies intellectual property.people often ask which industries win and which lose from trade deals. some industries will undoubtedly benefit from specific tariff reductions, such as seafood companies under the canada - eu free trade deal. but overall, the firms that will benefit the most from freer access to global markets are those that do their homework, make deep local connections, and ."
2015-01-01,Kyle Matthews: The war on education,"more than two weeks have passed since the senseless school attack in peshawar, pakistan, by the taliban left more than 130 children dead. but the pain has not gone away hundreds of families remain in mourning, a country is in shock and the international community is wondering what can be done to protect students from such violence.that this cowardly use of force against young civilians took place just shortly after pakistan s malala yousafzai was awarded the nobel peace prize, alongside co - winner kailash satyarthi, an indian activist, should not surprise anyone.malala survived an assassination attempt by the pakistani taliban in 2012 in swat valley. she was targeted because of her efforts to ensure more girls attend school and empower themselves through education. the person believed to have ordered malala s murder and the attack against the school in peshawar is maulana fazlullah. he is better known as because of his preaching on an illegal radio station years ago in which he frequently condemned girls going to school, arguing it goes against the teachings of islam.commenting on the peshawar massacre, malala stated, i, along with millions of others around the world, mourn these children, my brothers and sisters but we will never be defeated. unfortunately non - state actors have been increasingly targeting educational institutions in recent years. just last december in afghanistan, taliban supporters launched a against a french school in kabul. while children and teachers gathered in the school auditorium to watch a play about the dangers of suicide attacks, someone slipped into the crowd and blew himself up, killing one.but the problem is not just limited to south asia. in nigeria the islamist group boko haram has carried out a series of deadly raids and attacks against non - religious educational institutions. the kidnapping of more than is just the most recent case. the group has made clear that targeting schools is a religious duty and that they , regardless of global public opinion or international human rights law.you know things are getting worse when an organization is formed to confront the problem. the gcpea was established in 2010 by numerous organizations who were concerned about on - going attacks on educational institutions, their students, and staff in countries affected by conflict and insecurity. gcpea is governed by a steering committee comprised of the council for at - risk academics, human rights watch, the institute of international education, save the children, as well several united nations agencies.the atlantic recently reported on the university of maryland s global terrorism database that that the problem has gotten worse in the past decade. while attacks against educational institutions sometimes occurred at the ratio of 100 per year at certain periods in the 1980s and 1990s, generally they would fluctuate at about 50. beginning in 2004, the numbers have spiked upwards, reaching approximately 370 in 2013.in response to the school attack in peshawar, gordon brown, the former prime minister of the united kingdom and current un special envoy for global education, argued that we should be defining attacks on schools as crimes against humanity. schools that already have the same legal rights under international law as hospitals should also be the subject of agreements that they never become instruments of war. in the wake of the peshawar attack, a consensus has emerged that increased global cooperation is needed to protect schools and students. the late nelson mandela accurately once noted that education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. we must not lose sight of the fact that those targeting schools and students know this to be an absolute truth."
2015-01-01,"Accused in Tanger shooting targeted man from Crips family, police say","ottawa police have ended a record year of shootings by arresting a man they allege shot and wounded another crips gang member at a crowded outlet mall on boxing day, sending a sea of shoppers and the city into panic.the accused, 26 - year - old yaqoub ali, like many of the persons of interest and even victims in the 49 reported shootings in 2014, is well known to the police guns and gangs unit.police arrested ali on tuesday afternoon after executing two east - end warrants. he appeared in court the morning of new year s eve to be formally charged with almost a dozen firearms - related offences, including possession of a firearm obtained by crime, endangering public safety and discharging with the intent to wound, endanger life or prevent arrest. investigations into other shootings in ottawa remain underway and we are significantly increasing the number of guns and gangs investigators looking into those cases. police have more than doubled investigators in the guns and gangs unit, adding 10 additional detectives to a team of usually eight at the tail end of what has, by sheer numbers alone, been ottawa s year of the gun.police say the year was marked by infighting among cells of what would otherwise be the same factions. allegiances are fleeting, and yaqoub ali s year highlights that.his alleged victim is part of a storied family with ties to the crips street gang.adel al - enzi was shot once in the foot with a .40 - calibre handgun in an alley of the outdoor tanger outlets mall on december 26, just two days before his 22nd birthday. adel was unco - operative with officers and police said that all five people believed to have been involved in the shooting were affiliated with the crips street gang.adel al - enzi himself was convicted in 2013 of dangerous driving and operating a motor vehicle while disqualified, and in 2012 of identity fraud and failing to stop for police. the driving charges are signature police tactics when dealing with persons continually under police monitoring. police conduct traffic stops on persons of interest and lay charges when they can.the motive of the boxing day shooting, investigators said, was infighting between crips members.in january, he was arrested with seven other men after police disrupted a home takeover at an apartment on baycrest drive.home takeovers occur when those in the drug trade seize control of a residence, usually by force or by plying the resident with drugs, so they can use it for criminal purposes. ali was charged with drug possession for the purpose of trafficking, possession of proceeds of crime and forcible confinement, but was convicted in february only of drug possession and unlawful entry.he paid a 400 fine and spent just 22 days in jail, after which he was back on the streets.at the time of the home takeover arrests, police seized two loaded handguns plus ammunition, marijuana and crack cocaine.arrested alongside ali in january was the brother of a man he s alleged to have shot on boxing day, suggesting that the gang ties that police have been investigating aren t ones that bind. members of one family can begin the year co - accused with a man, who will, by year s end, allegedly target their kin.adel and abdulaziz are half - brothers of nawaf al - enzi, who is awaiting a second trial for what s alleged to be the gangland execution of ledbury - banff crips member and drug dealer mohamad zalal.zalal, 22, was shot once in the back of the head as he was driven in a car along highway 417 in 2006. nawaf al - enzi was accused of being the trigger man. in august the court of appeal ruled that nawaf was the subject of a miscarriage of justice when no lawyer wanted to take on his defence midway through trial, forcing him to represent himself. his conviction was overturned. a new trial date has not yet been set.appearing by video from the courthouse cellblock wednesday morning, ali the final suspect charged by anti - gang police in 2014 wore a dark - coloured winter jacket. he kept his head down and his hands clasped in front of him for most of his brief appearance. he was ordered by the court not to communicate with the alleged target of his gunfire. the crown didn t consent to his release.ali is next scheduled to appear in court january 7 by video. shootings arrests of gang members and associates made by police crime guns seized number of previously arrested gang associates found by police to be breaching release conditions once back in the community in 2014"
2015-01-01,Paddlers rescued from freezing Ottawa River on New Year's Eve,"ottawa firefighters rescued four very lucky people who lost their canoe but not their lives after being rescued from the ottawa river just half an hour into the new year.a 911 call made around 12 37 a.m. new year s day alerted rescue crews to people stranded in a boat behind the supreme court of canada in downtown ottawa.ottawa fire service spokesperson marc messier said two water and ice rescue units found two men and two women in their 20s in a canoe clinging to an ice shelf in a desperate effort to stop their boat from being pulled downstream by the fast - moving currents.officials at the scene said the two couples wanted to do something different and adventurous to welcome in 2015. the currents are very strong there and dangerous at any time, said messier. but with the thaw last week and the rains the current is even stronger than usual. the situation was so precarious a third rescue unit was dispatched to the scene.the first rescue boat immediately went out to find the stranded paddlers and attempted to get them on a stable platform. then more boats were sent to ferry the stranded people to shore and keep crews safe. the two women were the first to be brought to shore, where they were assessed by paramedics.rescue workers stayed with the other stranded paddlers until they were able to be brought to shore. fortunately, none of them were wet otherwise hypothermia would have been a factor and it would have become an even more complicated rescue, said messier. and none of them had life jackets on. they were very lucky. messier said this rescue was particularly dangerous due to the darkness, fast moving ice and frigid waters.the ice floes catch the rescue crews lines, causing them to get entangled. there is also the risk of the ice damaging the rescue crafts as they are tossed by the strong currents, or tipping passengers into the freezing water. if you fall in the water you can get pulled underneath the ice and get trapped, he said.all four paddlers were assessed by paramedics and released after being reminded about water safety.they also lost their canoe. crews were going to attempt to recover it but decided it was not worth risking firefighters lives, said messier. so it is still out there, stuck on an ice floe somewhere.

2015-01-01,Reevely: No sign yet of an LCBO 'express' store in Ottawa,"the province s plans to open liquor outlets inside grocery stores isn t moving along as quickly as planned. when finance minister charles sousa , he said at least some of the first 10 meant for a pilot project would be open by the end of the year.as i write, they ve got nine hours. doesn t look likely.in november, the lcbo it was moving toward leases for three locations one in toronto, one in mississauga, one in london. no deals done yet.i asked today, new year s eve, whether there s any progress toward a location in ottawa. there s no further update on lcbo express stores, macgregor told me.i m reading dregs a bit here, but i take from that that they re not on the verge of opening one of these here yet.the lcbo express concept is pretty restrictive, of course. last april, the lcbo spelled out its requirements for a store wanting to host a kiosk store, including that it have its own walls and separately lockable doors, be staffed by lcbo employees and keep its own hours. it d need its own secure storage room and either 2,000 or 3,000 square feet of floor space.the host stores will collect rent but the construction and implementation costs will be their own.in ottawa, the lcbo specified that it only wanted to hear from large grocery stores in a highly defined area, essentially part of vanier and new edinburgh, that it considers underserved by liquor stores so rather than exploring a model that might disrupt its existing business, the lcbo would just open a new location in a place it would probably want to open one anyway, except inside a supermarket.it s a pretty timid process, with a little more in it for the lcbo than for the host supermarket but not really very much in it for anybody. probably no big surprise it s not zipping along."

2015-01-01,Elections commissioner won't take Guelph robocalls case further,"investigators are not taking any steps to contact a key figure in the guelph robocalls case, despite a judicial finding that others were likely involved with the scheme that sent conservative campaign worker michael sona to jail late last year.after green party leader elizabeth may filed a complaint with commissioner of canada elections yves c t , officials from his office met with her to discuss the matter but advised they could do little to continue the investigation without new evidence.may wrote to c t in november asking him to investigate based on two judicial findings, including the sona verdict, in which judge gary heard noted the probability others were involved in the scheme that sent more than 7,000 automated calls to voters in guelph in the 2011 election. the calls directed voters to wrong polling stations.though he made no finding of who else may have participated, hearn specifically referred to guelph conservative campaign manager ken morgan and campaign worker andrew prescott, who was given immunity from prosecution in return for testimony against sona that hearn would later find largely useless.morgan, who ran the campaign of conservative candidate marty burke, has never been interviewed by the investigators who eventually brought charges against sona, the campaign s communications director.sona, 26, proclaimed his innocence even as he was convicted and sent off to jail in november. he has filed an appeal of his conviction and nine month sentence. he was freed on bail after spending 10 days in a provincial jail, pending the appeal.morgan s name appears 44 times in the judgment against sona but, as hearn noted, he was the only senior member of the guelph conservative campaign who didn t give testimony at trial.morgan refused to speak to elections canada investigators, according to court documents. the evidence and or absence of evidence might lead to the conclusion that one or more individuals were involved in this plan, hearn wrote. that may or may not be mr. prescott as alleged by the defence or may or may not be mr. morgan. in her office on parliament hill in early december, may met with c t s senior director of investigations, eric ferron, and his investigator, john dickson. they told her they would not be proceeding based on information she had provided but did not rule out reopening the case should new information arise.a spokesperson for c t s office said all the evidence from the guelph investigation has already been handed over to the crown for sona s trial.in his decision, hearn wrote that morgan had access to the conservative party voter - contact database, cims, that was the likely source of telephone numbers for identified non - conservative supporters. he also seemed to have been involved in obtaining contact information for racknine, the edmonton call centre used to launch the illegal calls, hearn said.during his testimony at sona s trial, prescott said morgan had emailed him to ask for a contact information for matt meier, who ran the edmonton - based voice broadcasting firm that the burke campaign had used previously for legitimate robocalls.prescott also described how morgan approached him on election day, after the misleading calls had gone out, and told him to log into racknine to stop the calls. morgan gave prescott a piece of paper with the login id and password for client 93, the racknine account set up under the fake name pierre jones that was used to launch the the calls.why morgan had the login information for the account was never addressed at trial.at last report, morgan was still living in kuwait and working at the american creativity academy, a private school in kuwait city that teaches a western curriculum. he has not commented publicly on the case that put the campaign he ran at the centre of the national political scandal.before moving overseas in august 2012, morgan had a long history with conservative politics in the guelph region. he had run for a position on guelph city council in 2006, but lost narrowly, and had also been president of the local conservative riding association. he managed the losing campaign of conservative candidate brent barr in 2006.through the riding association, he helped organize fundraising events with guest speakers such as former reform party leader preston manning, former alberta premier ralph klein, and senator doug finley, who had run the conservatives 2006 and 2008 federal election campaigns.in his candidate biography, morgan described himself as a husband and father and said he had a b.a. in political science from york university. his occupation was not clear, but morgan claimed accreditation in the fields of operation management and health and safety.in may 2011, shortly after the election, morgan graduated from niagara university in western new york with a master s degree in education, specializing in the primary and junior divisions.prescott testified that he had some infrequent contact with morgan since he moved to kuwait and said he suggested morgan consider an immunity deal of the kind the crown granted him.now, however, it appears unlikely morgan will ever be required to give evidence and may never even face questions from investigators.canada has no extradition treaty with kuwait."

2015-01-01,People to watch in 2015: Michael Maidment is feeding Ottawa's hungry,"michael maidment appears calm and collected despite working around the clock for the past several weeks. the executive director of the ottawa food bank kept hectic hours for much of november and december on food drives and fundraising events to feed the capital s hungry.more than 51,000 people turn to the food bank for help every month. that adds up to hundreds of thousands of cans of tuna, jars of peanut butter, loaves of bread and fresh fruit and veggies. but maidment, who s only been at the helm of the charitable organization for 16 months, isn t daunted by having to collect and distribute these mega volumes of food. i had a manager who used to call me spock, he said when asked to explain his ultra - calm demeanour in the throes of the stressful holiday rush. flashing his boyish dimples, he quipped, if your house is on fire, do you want someone who freaks out or someone who puts it out not even one recent forecast of 25 centimetres of snow rattles him. growing up in grand falls, nfld., he recalls one winter morning waking up to 90 cm of the white stuff, forcing he and his younger brother to crawl out a window to dig out the front door and help their dad find the car buried in the driveway.a lifelong member of the salvation army church, maidment, 40, was taught from an early age about helping those in need. his grandmother, whom he accompanied to church every sunday as a young boy, was an active volunteer and devoted hours to the salvation army s annual red shield fundraiser around the holidays. neighbour helping neighbour that s just what you do in a small town, says the kanata father of two, who worked for about seven years for the salvation army before being hired by the food bank in august 2013. that upbringing set me up for this job. what we do as an organization, we did as a small community. the food bank just operates on a much, much larger scale. what strikes me is how generous people are, says maidment, who credits a network of corporate sponsors, private donors and volunteers for helping the food bank meet the growing public demand. former ctv anchor max keeping always said ottawa is the most generous community. he s right. but as food costs, housing prices and hydro and property tax bills continue to climb, more families, single parents, seniors on a fixed income and new canadians will be forced to lean on the food bank for assistance in 2015. does maidment have a plan of attack to meet these mounting pressures macro thinking. i tell my staff it s seeing the issue from 30,000 feet, says mr. cool, who confesses to lying awake at night doing a lot of strategic planning. at the top of his to - do list is increasing the volume of organic produce the food bank s community harvest program grows on donated land in stittsville and expanding the variety of nutritious foods available to clients. he d also like to implement a more efficient system for sorting through the mountain of grocery store bins in the warehouse and continue to grow the food bank s surplus revenue fund so extra food can be purchased when donations typically dwindle between january and march.maidment was looking forward to some quiet time over the holidays with his wife leanne, daughter emma, 12 and son gabriel, 9. but feeding the hungry will not be far from his thoughts. i feel privileged to do this job. it s a very rewarding role, said maidment from his bright office where a collection of starbucks mugs i love my americano and a cfl football signed by redblacks quarterback henry burris, are displayed on a shelf near his desk. i get to feed people it makes the hours and stress really worth it. years the ottawa food bank has been operatingthe number of people whouse the food bank every month the size of the food bank warehouse in gloucesterhow much food was donated to the food bank last fiscal year october 1, 2013 to sept. 30, 2014 the amount of food the weight equivalent of 55 elephants distributed by the food bank in a monthhow many cans of tuna distributed last year how much the food bank spent on peanut butter last year 33,324 kg the yield of vegetables and fruit grown on donated land in stittsville last year the number of volunteers who help deliver, pick up and sort food, answer phones and work special events number of agencies the food bank supports"

2015-01-01,"Architect Barry Padolsky talks about intensification, the LRT and his own home (with video)","barry padolsky s face might not be well known in the city, but his work has certainly shaped the face of ottawa. he is the architect behind the bank street bridge restoration, the byward market building, the rideau canal museum and, most spectacularly, the renovated museum of nature, just to name a few.and yet, he has no desire to design and build his own home. along with his partner of 35 years, evelyn stone, the urban planner and heritage architect lives in the same house he bought with a couple of buddies back in 1969. in fact, he still occupies only the downstairs apartment of the century - old home while renting out the other three units. it s like few other apartments in the city however along embassy row in sandy hill overlooking strathcona park on the rideau river.now 75, a father to one daughter and proud grandfather of three, padolsky grew up in the north end of winnipeg, the oldest of three brothers and the son of a homemaker and pressman. even today, that working - class background continues to have an influence on how he sees the city he lives in and his boundless dreams for its future. i always joke about the one influence that i ve had on barry s architectural style is closets. when i first moved in 35 years ago,barry and i shared a little tiny closet. i realized our relationship was serious when he actually built his own closet laughs . but what s lovely about this house is it has a wonderful feeling about it and it didn t need a lot. i had heard the word architect and i said architect when asked . i used to get this reaction from the adults and i went with it, because i liked the reaction that i got.what i really wanted to be, at one point, was a union organizer, because of my father a pressman , being in the north end of winnipeg and the labour movement. he talked me out of that. he said, it s not going to be a satisfying career, even though ideologically it s something you want to do. i recommend you go into architecture. so i did. and that s how i got into it; not knowing anything about what it entailed laughs . architecture is about observing the environment in which you live, our cities, and wanting to do something to enhance them. you need to understand the needs of communities and then find ways to meet them in a way that ennobles human life it s got to be pleasurable, delightful, inspiring, and sometimes that s the hardest part. intensification is the only way to be able to harness and conserve our resources, both natural and space. but it s all about how we do it. the first moves that we ve made in the last 20, 40 years in ottawa have been to intensify existing neighbourhoods and we ve had the wars between developers and residents .i think the big opportunities we have for intensification are in the unbuilt nodes along the lrt light rail transit line this is the opportunity to create a sort of necklace of city communities along the lrt, each one of which is more desirable than the next. we should have these florences, these venices, as the next generation of urbanity for ottawa. this is tough. i have practised here for a number of decades and i ve worked with the ncc national capital commission , the city of ottawa, with the other agencies, and, yes, there s a certain amount of over - governance, rivalries etc.but, we ve been building great cities for thousands of years. so why would we lose the touch the city of ottawa has adopted a downtown urban design strategy and, if you read that, that s the blueprint for creating great spaces to live, work and play.let s have the guts to actually carry that out rather than watering it down. lebreton flats needs to come into its own as an irresistible mixed - use community to complement the lonely canadian war museum. it s right on the ottawa river. it s walking distance to the core. it will have its own lrt station.yes, the ncc has been the rather pompous but ineffective parent of lebreton flats for almost 50 years since it was urban renewed namely slum - cleared by the federal government in the 1960s. and the ncc s first child in lebreton the new cluster of condos has not exactly generated public love or burnished the ncc s reputation. without question, a new canada science and technology museum should be built at lebreton. our current government knows this but, shamefully, has no interest.the recent ncc announcement, however, that it is seeking fresh development proposals from the private sector for the undeveloped lands gives some reason for cautious optimism.another reason for optimism is the recent acquisition of the former domtar lands surrounding the chaudi re falls by windmill developments. the windmill master plan for these former industrial waterfront islands is quite imaginative.both the chaudi re islands and lebreton flats were the birthplace of ottawa. they deserve to be developed in a manner that respects their rich heritage and enhances the livability of the national capital. at the time in 1969 70, i was living in centretown in an apartment like this in a big beautiful house and centretown was being demolished and they were building highrise buildings. so, a couple of friends of mine, we all became homeless because we had to move out of these wonderful old houses. we banded together and three of us bought this place. we each had an apartment in it and, eventually, my architectural partner died and the other moved on.why haven t i designed my own house it s a temptation to design your own house, but, for me to be comfortable is to live in a place that has been designed by another.because if i ve designed it, i m going to be redesigning it in my mind over and over and over again. it would be an endless project. when i was child my heroes were people like karl marx, lenin all the left - wing ideologues that i ve now grown out of. i then got into hockey heroes. billy mosienko. who knows about him he was from winnipeg, played for the chicago blackhawks. i used to set pins in his bowling alley in the north end of winnipeg.architecturally, i much admired the modern greats, like frank lloyd wright, ludwig mies van der rohe, antoni gaud .very eclectic.in terms of thinkers, probably most influenced by lewis mumford, who wrote the culture of cities and the city in history. he was one of the great modern thinkers about urban culture and also he was an advocate of change. urban activist jane jacobs as well because, in a way, i m a student of cities and history. dubrovnik in croatia. it s a wonderful walled town and i did live there for a year when i was studying urban planning and writing my thesis. it was the epitome of urbanity. it was an oligarchy, so if you d lived there during its 1,000 years of supremacy in the adriatic, you d have had to have been one of the members of a few families because all the rest were basically serfs. but, physically, it s a walking town. so, it s a perfect world, with wonderful caf s along the adriatic. hopefully as someone who made a contribution to this community. that s pretty inane, but something to aspire to."
2015-01-01,"Good news, bad news for the Senators Marc(k)s Brothers","time for an attitude question, ottawa senators fans.are you bringing in the new year with a glass is half full toast of optimism or are you crying in your half empty glass of beer the good news bad news from the marc k s brothers in the final practice of 2014 wednesday probably won t help sway the mood, either way.on the positive side, marc methot returned to practice with the team for the first time since december 6 and talked confidently about his health and the possibility of returning for a conditioning stint with binghamton of the american hockey league in the near future.the negative scene arrived when mark borowiecki limped into the dressing room on crutches, talking about his freak accident while playing soccer before monday s game, resulting in the deep gash, through the muscle in his left leg, which required 48 stitches to close.before we get into details and prognosis for methot and borowiecki, it s expected that the senators will recall a defenceman from binghamton before saturday s game against the boston bruins. chris wideman has been an offensive star on the blue line for binghamton, but if the team wants to add a steady defensive presence, the call could go out to fredrik claesson or alex grant, who has been impressive throughout december.now, back to methot, who has played only two games this season december 4 and december 6 while nursing his mysterious back butt hip injury. it s much better now, there s no question, methot said, comparing the current return to his attempted comeback to the ice in early december. there s a lot more jump in my step and way less hesitation. i just feel more comfortable and i m in a better mood because of it when i m out there on the ice. before joining the team at practice, methot had skated on his own for four days, and he was content with his conditioning level following an up - tempo workout that included plenty of yelling from coach dave cameron.during the next few days, cameron, the club s management and methot will discuss the possibility of playing in binghamton before jumping directly back into the nhl. the b - sens, who played wednesday, are in wilkes - barre scranton friday and at home against syracuse saturday. we can t simulate game conditions, said cameron. he s feeling well. it s nice to see him back on the ice. probably the next step is contact and game situations, but he will certainly only play if all the medical stuff is lined up. naturally, cameron wants methot back as soon as possible, but he also understands the need for patience. the concern is how far he s behind in the fitness, he said. you can t fast forward fitness. to me, that s the question mark. the senators coach also understands the need for patience with what is expected to be a long recovery for borowiecki. the deep cut, from borowiecki s shin all the way around to his calf he described it as a you shape means he ll spend at least a week on crutches, with a boot over his left leg. there s no time line on a recovery after that.borowiecki understands that some people might think he was being careless, but he suggests he was doing nothing different than he has done while warming up for every game in the past six years. we weren t doing anything too silly there, i just happened to run by one of the electrical boxes out there and i felt something brush against my leg, he said. it didn t hurt too, too much when it happened but when i looked down at what it was, obviously i was a little shook up. i dropped in panic. i saw how bad the cut was. the instinctive thought was i probably shouldn t be walking on it, when you see something that serious. he says was fortunate that a group of teammates, including robin lehner, craig anderson, jean - gabriel pageau and bobby ryan, were superb first responders, immediately putting pressure on the gushing wound.before the injury, borowiecki had established himself as a valuable every day defender for the senators, leading the team in both hits and blocked shots. it s tough when you get into a rhythm like that and you have to shut it down. it kind of messes with you mentally, but right now, its so early in the injury, i can t really think about that. as devastating as the injury is, cameron will not institute a no - soccer policy. he believes it s a good warm - up exercise. you don t want to get to the point as a coach where you re controlling everything, said cameron. it wasn t careless. it was freak and you can t control freak. still, when the coach was asked about his new year s resolutions for his team, he mentioned health at the top of the list."

2015-01-01,Ottawa's Ivanie Blondin takes charge of her skating and her team,"this time last year ivanie blondin was feeling burned out.she had trained too hard in the summer of 2013 and was suffering a skater s version of dead arm, the affliction that baseball pitchers get when they have over - worked. i was the only girl in my training group last season. i got really strong, but by october i was burned out. i was always tired and my heart rates were all off. it was hard to even qualify for the olympics. i suffered from mono three years ago. it felt like that. every morning, getting up was a chore. it didn t matter how many hours i slept. but that was then. today the ottawa native is feeling at the top of her game. the fall long - track speed skating season has been a success. blondin has collected five medals; two golds, a silver and two bronzes and is at the top of the mass start standings. her background in short - track skating has helped in that discipline. and while there is an with the upper echelons of her sport. the on - ice performance has been stellar.and one of those gold medals came in a mass start competition in heerenveen, the netherlands against her great rival irene schouten.now blondin is back on the ice in her new hometown of calgary taking part in the canadian single distance championships in calgary until january 5. after that she is to head to hamar, norway for the next world cup weekend january 31 to february 1. this year i have proven that i am a lot stronger than i have been in the past few seasons. she credits taking two months of this past summer. that has helped her in races like the mass starts, with 3,000 and 5,000 metre races and even helped her reach into shorter distances like the 1,000 and the 1,500 metres. i m not a sprinter but for some reason this season i have the snap in me. i m fresh and not over - trained so everything is just clicking right now. speed skaters are highly tuned athletes, like any world class performer, so it may seem counterintuitive to not train, but for blondin, that was what i needed; to just get out of the sport and take to my motorcycle. this speed demon owns a kawasaki ninja 300 and used to own a dirt bike until she sold it.she also went home to ottawa for awhile for some real homecooking and just started running and cycling, exercises she enjoys.after the break she returned to calgary feeling much better and started to pick up the pace. her workouts began in earnest aerobic training, some weights and something that is specific to her sport. we do a lot of imitations off the ice. that is imitating skating without being on skates and on the grass. these exercises include squatting, jumping up to 1,000 jumps at day and low walks.she trained five to seven hours a day, five days a week. on saturday morning she would take a long bike ride. sunday was a day of rest.but it s more than just feeling strong. blondin has a renewed confidence. i feel naturally comfortable and confident. speed skating is a weird sport because it is mostly individual. this season we didn t have all the top girls there anymore like christine nesbitt and brittany schussler. there was just me. and there were a lot of rookies coming in who thought they were hot stuff .blondin explains that in speed skating, younger skaters are expected to respect the top dogs. when nesbitt was here, everything that she would tell me to do i would do. i would just shut my mouth. she says that the rookies were ignoring her until the first competition of the year when she put them in their place with a win on the ice.this year is the beginning of a new olympic cycle leading up to the games in pyeongchang, korea in 2018 and blondin believes she is a leader on the canadian team. i ve always liked the idea of being a leader. i watched nesbitt for four years and watched how she dealt with it. leadership is handed down on the long - track team from catriona le may doan to cindy klassen to christine nesbitt and now to blondin. it has always kind of been that way, seniority is everything. of all the races this fall, blondin really cherishes the win in holland.it was in front of irene schouten s home crowd. it crushed her. i defeated her on her own turf. it was kind of cool. the crowd, it s always unbelievable there. it s like hockey is in canada. blondin stayed in calgary for the holidays and told her mom and dad not to come out. once i get close to a competition i don t really want anyone bugging me. so she celebrated christmas with her fianc , her dog and her bird in her big apartment.the dog is a great pyrenees named mowgli after the character in the jungle book. she does have a backyard and lots of parkland nearby for the dog. she says she wants to get a newfoundland pooch and call it baloo after another jungle book character.she has an african gray parrot named gizmo. i ve had him for four years. it s like having a child. when blondin was a child she says she always drew pictures of herself with a parrot on her shoulder. perhaps she is a pirate at heart.she does love animals though and is taking veterinary technician courses that will finish in march. she is considering veterinary school after she is done with speed skating. but that might be awhile.blondin intends to compete in 2018. she will be 28 then. after that she will reassess whether to keep going.as a leader on the canadian team, she is watching to see who is on the rise. one skater is laurent dubreuil from levis, quebec, who has several medals this season too. he is one to watch for, especially in the sprinting. this year, it has clicked for him. he was strong last year but didn t do it in qualification. vincent de ha tre from the ottawa area is another skater to keep an eye on, she says."

2015-01-01,Heartbleed worried government for months after bug was supposedly fixed,"the heartbleed bug remained a concern for the federal government three months after it was supposed to have been patched to protect taxpayers personal information, according to an internal government report.heartbleed forced the canada revenue agency to shut down its online services at the height of tax season and publicly admit that it had lost the personal information on 900 taxpayers. a london, ont. man is facing multiple charges in relation to the incident.a government report penned in july reviewing the lessons learned from heartbleed provides a detailed timeline of events, showing how quickly and how many people across government were brought to mitigate the damage heartbleed caused and continued to because even in july.the highly redacted report shows the cra and shared services canada knew on april 10 that 900 social insurance numbers had been removed from government systems, and turned the file over to the mounties that very day.the report also found that government departments had to rethink their communications strategies, and further define who was in charge of what should a similar technological crisis arise in the future. it is important to note that the heartbleed event was, and still remains, a serious security vulnerability, one of the most serious that has affected the gc and the internet as a whole , reads the treasury board report obtained by the citizen under the access to information act. it is a complex and widespread cyber vulnerability that requires horizontal coordination of all departments and agencies in order to ensure timely and effective mitigation. a treasury board spokeswoman said an inter - departmental working group was tasked to address issues identified in the report. fiona macleod said government security policies may be updated if the working group decides to change roles and responsibilities in the case of a cyber incident, and communication protocols are are also being reviewed. the goal is to improve the current system to ensure the right information reaches the right people at the right time, macleod said in an email. as well, a communications protocol for it incidents has been developed to ensure timely communications with canadians and partners by appropriate departmental spokespersons. is a flaw in a common online security software that makes it possible to see secure or encrypted information. although it had existed for almost two years, security researchers were only able to identify it in april.the first notes about the problem were made public on april 7. it wasn t until the morning of april 8 that the government s cyber response centre sent out a government - wide note about heartbleed.that same morning, cra officials testified before a commons committee, but said nothing about heartbleed. according to the report, it wasn t until the afternoon of april 8 that the cra found its online tax filing systems, efile and netfile, were vulnerable. the cra took the systems offline while it workers tried to patch the problem.treasury board then ordered departments to take down vulnerable public - facing websites until the problem could be patched. patching took a matter of days, macleod said.the report says that patching work continued beyond the end of april as commercial software providers released patches. mark nunnikhoven, vice - president cloud and emerging technologies from security the firm trend micro, said that s understandable in the first few days of a cyber incident, systems are triaged with the most critical areas receiving patches first, followed by a long tail where systems of decreasing importance are repaired.that s what happened with heartbleed, nunnikhoven said, with a large number of people brought in, a hotline opened, and alerts and reports flowing from departments to a central war room. it s a good system, they responded relatively quickly from the public point of view because there s always going to be bugs in software, he said. but, you can always get better. becomes aware of heartbleed bug and prepares information on it for distribution.ccirc sends out notice to 10 public bodies, including the rcmp, crtc, csis, bank of canada, and public works, in the morning. government - wide alert follows.in the afternoon, shared services canada tells the canada revenue agency that online filing systems efile and netfile are vulnerable. cra decides to shut down e - services. public safety canada asks other departments about potential issues similar to the one found at cra.series of teleconferences with departmental chief information officers take place with the communication security establishment cse participating. report says on this day departments and agencies accelerate patching efforts. shared services canada confirms exfiltration of personal information from the cra network, specifically the social insurance numbers of 900 taxpayers. ssc notifies rcmp of incident and officially requests support for investigation. treasury board president tony clement announces all departments have been asked to disable public - facing websites until patches can be installed.the cra alerts the federal privacy commissioner s office about the data breach. the rcmp ask the cra to delay saying anything publicly about the breach so it can continue to its investigation.cra commissioner gives approval at 3 p.m. et to restart all online services. efile and netfile are brought online late afternoon. the cra then completes system health checks for efile and netfile and confirms online status. the report doesn t specify when this check took place, but it was between april 13 and 14. treasury board confirms that service to public - facing government websites has been restored.cra releases public statement that services have been restored and alerts the public of the privacy breach. public safety canada convenes a meeting of teams from 12 departments and agencies, including the privy council office, rcmp, csis, ssc and cse to discuss heartbleed. in relation to the heartbleed hack at cra. he is charged with two counts of malicious breach. months later, , from mischief to data to unlawful use of a computer citing further victims from the hack. source ottawa citizen, rcmp, treasury board report obtained by citizen "
2015-01-01,"This year, try a New Year's mantra rather than a resolution","new year s resolutions always start off with promise, but tends to fizzle as we get busy following the holiday season.a few ottawa yoga teachers suggest trying something different this year choose a mantra. in many respects, a new year s resolution is a kind of mantra. but, like mantras, resolutions must be practiced daily if you re serious about them becoming your way of living, says devinder kaur, director of pranashanti yoga centre in hintonburg.what is a mantra kaur says it s a tool that allows us to train the mind through repetition. it s made up of the two words in the classical indian language, sanskrit or mind and meaning instrument. unlike a resolution, which is stated once at the beginning of the year, a mantra is repeated every day as a way to reinforce and reflect on your intention. living here in canada, the easiest thing for us to do is create our own mantra in english. something that feels important to us, kaur says.she keeps sticky notes on her computer. each one has a different mantra - like affirmation on it to remind her to reflect every day. one of them reads i am grateful to have the right job at the right time, so happy that it has materialized so rapidly and so properly. anyone who s taken a yoga class will have chanted at the beginning or end of the session. this is an ancient mantra based on sound and vibration, but it may not resonate with some people. you can repeat but for some people it doesn t have a lot of context. i think that s why it s more powerful to set an intention, says cat edward, who teaches yoga at studios across the city and on parliament hill in the summer.she encourages people to set an intention instead of a traditional mantra. she suggests taking five or 10 minutes every day to meditate or even just be quiet and think about what positive things you want to bring into your life.the best time of day to set your intention is the morning, she says. that way you can revisit it throughout the day, especially if you find yourself feeling stressed, or if you re really busy, you can always go back to your intention and feel a little more grounded, edward says.for example, a positive intention might be to remind yourself to love your body. i don t think setting a new year s resolution to lose weight is effective, but setting an intention to maybe have more fun with fitness or loving your body is more effective and longer - lasting, edward suggests.repeating an intention or mantra doesn t have to be done during a formal meditation session. it can be done at any point in the day, whether you re washing the dishes or standing in line at a store.for jennifer stow, who has taught yoga for 11 years, a mantra can be as simple as repeating let go to yourself.she also thinks january is the wrong time for most people to make a change. it s in the middle of winter, everything is frozen. from a yoga perspective, it s not the time to make massive changes. we do that in the spring and the fall because those are transition seasons, stow says.instead, stow tries to set goals or intentions in january that she will bring to fruition in the spring.for those interested in trying a mantra and wondering how to start, devinder kaur recommends a few for beginners i will practice forgiveness, beginning with myself. i will be more present in my actions and thoughts. i will be grateful for something every day.

2015-01-01,Heart &amp; Crown on Preston Street shuts down for week after liquor licence suspended,"after nearly four years of fighting claims that it over - served a party of birthday revellers, the heart crown irish pub has begun serving a seven - day suspension of its liquor licence.alex munro, the bar s vice - president of business operations, said the heart crown at 353 preston st. would remain closed from thursday new year s day at 11 a.m. through to january 7. it will reopen for business on january 8, when its liquor licence suspension is lifted. we are going to take the time as an opportunity to sand and stain our floors and bar - tops, he told the citizen in an email. the bar was, however, open for new year s eve celebrations.the suspension, levied against the bar by the alcohol and gaming commission of ontario, is the result of an incident in february 2011, when a group of 15 co - workers entered the bar for a birthday celebration. in a period of 65 minutes, 10 of those in the party consumed a total of 72 drinks.when it became apparent that several in the loud party were intoxicated, the bar cut them off and told them to leave. they complied. but one female member of the party, extremely drunk, was vomiting in a washroom.when four male members of the group re - entered the bar to assist her, they were confronted by the bar manager and a bouncer and told to leave, according to documents from a ruling on the case.when they refused, a physical confrontation ensued, the documents say. one of the four suffered a broken ankle so serious that it required screws and plates and prevented him from working for months.two weeks later, an inspector from the alcohol and gaming commission of ontario showed up to investigate. when he asked the manager for the video from the bar s surveillance cameras, a supervisor stopped the conversation, promising to produce the video the following week.a senior manager subsequently told the inspector that the bar s surveillance system only retained data for five or six days, so the video in question had already been erased, the documents say.in its 2013 decision, the licence appeal tribunal found the heart crown guilty of selling liquor to an intoxicated person, permitting drunkenness, disorderly conduct and practices that encourage immoderate consumption of alcohol , and of obstructing and failing to facilitate an inspection.it imposed a 10 - day licence suspension and ordered the pub to retain its video surveillance records for at least 30 days and to make them available on request to police officers and inspectors.the divisional court quashed the convictions relating to obstructing an investigation, permitting practices that encourage immoderate alcohol consumption and one charge of permitting drunkenness.with the appeal s partial success, the court agreed that some adjustment of the 10 - day suspension imposed by the tribunal was in order.the revision of the suspension was released on november 10 by the ontario superior court of justice, divisional court, calling for a seven - day liquor licence suspension as opposed to the 10 days originally proposed."
2015-01-01,Some say PM could justifiably shut down Parliament in crisis: survey,"a small but growing minority of canadians says the prime minister would be justified in closing down parliament and the supreme court in the face of very difficult times, according to a survey.the question about the two democratic institutions is part of the sweeping, biennial americasbarometer study, and canadians were among the citizens of 26 countries surveyed for their views and attitudes about democracy and governance.the canadian part of the online survey, conducted by environics institute and ottawa s institute on governance in the summer, recently released its results. it found 23 per cent of respondents said the prime minister would be justified in shutting down parliament when the country is facing a crisis or very difficult times, and 17 per cent would accept dissolving the supreme court for the same reason.the vast majority of canadians 77 per cent object to the idea of the prime minister silencing parliament, but what s noteworthy is that the size of the minority who could accept it under dire conditions has inched up since 2010 when only about 10 per cent said the prime minister would have grounds to govern without parliament or the supreme court in difficult times. by 2012, that percentage was 15.the proportion who said the same about the supreme court stayed about the same at 11 per cent in 2012 and rose to 17 per cent in 2014.the americas survey found canada was also among the countries most likely to support silencing their legislatures in such scenarios behind paraguay 29 per cent , peru 27 per cent and haiti 26 per cent . support for national leaders suspending their legislatures during crises was the lowest in venezuela 7 per cent , belize 8 per cent , guyana 8 per cent and uruguay 9 per cent .keith neuman, executive director of environics institute, said he couldn t explain the findings. canadians support democracy and the survey gave no indication of the kind of crisis that would warrant steps as drastic as suspending the judicial and legislative arms. there is nothing else in the data that clearly provides further insight into that, he said. there are no questions around that nor other trends that suggest a loss of confidence in democracy. it may be more about how people feel about the external world and circumstances and crises that could call for extraordinary responses i don t know if that is more present today than a couple of years ago. latin america has more of a history of constitutional suspension and insurrection than canada, which has had few threats to its civil order.the last time canada suspended civil liberties was for a domestic crisis, when then - prime minister pierre trudeau imposed the war measures act in response to the flq crisis of 1970. neither parliament nor the supreme court was suspended, however.the war measures act was adopted by parliament in 1914 after the outbreak of the first world war, allowing the government to suspend civil liberties and bypass parliament to maintain security and order during war or insurrection. it was also used during the second world war. it has since been replaced by the emergencies act.crises have forced parliament to temporarily shut such as when the building, then based in montreal, burned down in april of 1849 during riots over the approval of the rebellion losses bill.it was closed again after another fire in 1916 until a place was found where it could be reconvened. it was shut for the day on october 22 when michael zehaf - bibeau shot and killed cpl. nathan cirillo at the national war memorial, then rushed to parliament hill where he was killed during a gunfight.the supreme court has never been suspended and parliamentary expert ned franks says he can t conceive that it would be. the government could ignore it, but it can t shut it down. the court is autonomous, head of the judicial branch and the main feature of the separation of powers is that it is separate from the executive, said franks, a professor emeritus of political studies at queen s university.parliament must meet once every 12 months. in normal circumstances, it is prorogued at the end of a session and dissolved when an election is called. but experts said it s inconceivable what difficult times canada could face that would warrant such extraordinary action without consulting parliament. it is hard to imagine the situation where any useful purpose would be served by shutting down parliament or shutting down the courts, said rob walsh, parliament s former law clerk and chief legal adviser.the survey found the idea met minority support across the population but was somewhat higher among canadians on the political right, conservative party supporters, those without a high school diploma and immigrants. this increase since 2012 was most notable among younger canadians, those without a high school diploma, immigrants and those on the middle and right of the political spectrum.kmay ottawacitizen.comtwitter.com kathryn may"

time best friend, a schoolboy named petter, who had joined the hitler youth movement after the german invasion of the country in april 1940. they had not spoken since petter appeared at the boys high school in a crisp, nazi uniform. petter warned lemkow that there was to be a roundup of jewish men the next morning.lemkow, his father and two brothers fled into the night without stopping to pack. i shall forever remember my mother in the window, watching us hurrying down the street, lemkow once told an interviewer. that was the last time i was to see her. lemkow hid in an east end oslo apartment before being smuggled into sweden with the assistance of the norwegian underground in december 1942. that same month, his mother, dora, and sister, ethel, were shipped to poland and murdered at auschwitz. nobody believed the nazis would hurt the women and children and elderly, lemkow later said. it was just too hard to believe. that s how naive we were. everybody was. lemkow would survive the war, immigrate to canada, and forge a successful career as a filmmaker and stage director in ottawa, where he was also one of the city s best known holocaust survivors.lemkow died sunday at the ottawa hospital from the advance of skin cancer. he had just turned 89. he was always willing to take chances and step out of his comfort zone, his son, daniel, said in an interview thursday. he was someone who was always learning, always trying new things. louis chaim lemkow was born in oslo on december 27, 1925, the youngest son of a prosperous clothing store owner who had fled russia s anti - jewish pogroms. the ultraorthodox family lived in one of the city s finest neighbourhoods, which meant that lemkow grew up with few jewish friends. a boy who lived across the street, a lutheran named petter, was his constant companion. lemkow took part in petter s christmas and easter celebrations, while petter came to lemkow s bar mitzvah and shared the family s passover feasts.so it came as a shock when petter arrived in their high school class in the fall of 1941, dressed in the uniform of norway s hitlerjugend. decades after the war, in 1992, lemkow returned to norway and found petter. we spent two days together, he told the citizen in 1995. he explained that he had been swayed by the uniforms and the martial music but saw the light and quit the movement. only about 1,700 jews lived in norway when the nazi s invaded. more than half of them about 900 escaped to sweden with the help of the norwegian underground. others went into hiding to survive the war, but about 760 jews were deported to poland and murdered at auschwitz, according to the you.s. holocaust memorial museum.lemkow s mother, sister and many members of his extended family were among those killed at auschwitz.lemkow, his father and brothers hid in their oslo safe house for four months before they were led on a nine - day winter s trek through the forest into neutral sweden.in sweden, lemkow s father, sverre, built another successful business, this time as a furrier, and forcefully encouraged his youngest son to follow in his footsteps. but lemkow had other ideas he wanted a life in theatre. he studied music and ballet and travelled to england, where he met his wife, sonia. in 1951, they immigrated to canada with their infant son, daniel.lemkow worked as a cheesemonger and deli operator in montreal, then moved to ottawa where was hired by crawley films. for the next four decades, he produced documentaries and commercials and directed stage plays and immersed himself in the city s cultural scene. he volunteered his directing skills at ottawa little theatre and the national press club.former citizen columnist dave brown, who befriended lemkow after being directed by him in a press club stage play, remembered him thursday as a master of outside - the - box thinking. brown said lemkow was once shooting a commercial when a sudden autumn storm downed the colourful fall leaves that had served as the backdrop to his almost - completed scene. ever resourceful, lemkow sent his staff off to buy some cellophane tape while he headed to the nearest school. the next morning the trees were full of happy kids being paid to put the leaves back, brown recalled, and the missing scene was shot in close up. in addition to live theatre and opera, lemkow enjoyed golf, bridge, cooking and a good story. he was a longtime subscriber to the national arts centre orchestra and spent many hours, retelling his holocaust story to high school and university audiences. we must stop being naive, he once warned. the unbelievable did happen unless society stays aware of the danger, it can happen again. lemkow is survived by his wife, sonia, their children, daniel and deborah, and five grandchildren."
2015-01-01,New Year's Eve shooting pushes city's 2014 total to 49,"with only three hours to go before the new year and a fresh start, residents of elmira drive heard firearms rather than fireworks.just past 9 p.m. on wednesday, two to three shots were reported on the street near pinecrest park and not far from tuesday afternoon s shooting on bloomsbury crescent in the woodroffe avenue - baseline road area.police say no one was injured in the final shooting of 2014, and one suspect was on the loose. she will casings were recovered at the scene.while a number of ottawa s shootings this year have been gang - related, ottawa police said thursday that it was unknown why gunfire erupted on elmira drive. however, the force s guns and gang unit was investigating.the shooting was the 49th of 2014, capping off a record year of gun violence in the capital. in 2013, there were 30 shooting incidents in ottawa.a nearby resident named sue, who declined to give her last name, has lived in the area for 20 years and said 2014 had brought a surge of illegal activity. it s definitely about drugs, she said. there was a shot or two fired over the years, but nothing like this. this is just way out of control. wednesday s shooting follows an arrest by ottawa police on tuesday of a man they allege to have been involved in a boxing day shooting in kanata.yaqoub ali, 26, was arrested on december 30 after police executed two east - end warrants. police allege ali, who is believed to be part of the crips family, shot and wounded another crips gang member at the tanger outlets mall.ali, like many of the persons of interest and even victims in the 49 reported shootings of 2014, is well known to the police guns and gangs unit.he appeared in court the wednesday morning by video to be formally charged with almost a dozen firearms - related offences, including possession of a firearm obtained by crime and discharge of firearm with intent to wound, endanger life or prevent arrest. ali kept his head down and his hands clasped in front of him for most of his brief appearance. he was ordered by the court not to communicate with the alleged target of his gunfire.ali is the final suspect to be charged by anti - gang police in 2014 and is scheduled to appear in court again on january 7 by video.with a record number of shooting by year s end, police have more than doubled investigators in the guns and gangs unit, adding 10 detectives to a team that normally numbers eight. gun violence and the gang activity associated with it is an enforcement priority for our service, acting chief jill skinner said in a news release. investigations into other shootings in ottawa remain underway and we are significantly increasing the number of guns and gangs investigators looking into those cases. the concern surrounding the recent shootings have reached city hall, and one veteran councillor demanded this week that police chief charles bordeleau brief council on the city s gang problems. i think the chief needs to make a case for what resources this service needs, coun. diane deans said tuesday. is it a matter of resources is it a matter of shifting resources is it a matter of training i think we need to understand more about the fundamentals. coun. eli el - chantiry, chairman of the police services board, is expecting to meet with bordeleau next week and has said he wants the discussion to focus on long - term solutions to the city s gang problem. i m getting a little bit annoyed with handguns being so readily available in our city, el - chantiry told the citizen on thursday. that s something that we need to talk to the chief about and the chief will have the discussion with other levels of law enforcement, specifically the rcmp and the canadian border services agency, he said.el - chantiry said he also plans to talk to the chief about how police can clamp down on the drug trade, which is fuelling gang activity. there is a market for what these people are fighting for, he said.working with community partners like crime prevention ottawa and crime stoppers on strategies to keep young kids away from gangs is also a priority, el - chantiry said."
2015-01-01,"Sens fan stands up for his right, or at least desire, to stand up","when tyler cybulski was refused a standing - room ticket to last monday s ottawa senators game and told he d have to buy a seat, he knew one thing.he wasn t about to take it sitting down.even if that seat carried the same budget price of his usual spot at the canadian tire centre s top - tier rail. last season, cybulski attended 22 games, paying just under 25 a ticket. it s much more relaxed, it s a completely different experience, cybulski says of standing to spectate. you don t have people in front of you leaning forward, there are no obstructions. he s just 25, but the letter of protest he sent to the senators reflects an old hockey viewer s attitude. fans speak fondly of the blue - collar pride and elbows - out camaraderie of the crowded standing zones at rinks such as le forum and maple leaf gardens.modern rinks still have standing room, but they ve dialled back. a bigger change, however, is the dynamic pricing that has replaced set ticket fees with charges that can vary by the popularity of the visiting team, the day of the week and the number of tickets remaining. today s hockey fan is as much in the dark as an airline passenger as to what the occupant of the next seat has paid.for the senators, dynamic pricing has meant upper bowl seats for some games selling for the same price of a standing - room ticket, and sometimes even lower. fans have been puzzled, says club spokesman brian morris, and some who bought secondary market standing - room tickets arrived expecting to find seats. that led to a november decision to stop selling standing - room tickets while seats at the same price were available. we re trying to simplify the buying process and not have as much confusion, says morris.ending all confusion could be a tough task. cybulski says he was told the only available seat for monday s game against the buffalo sabres was quite a piece more than standing room, prompting him to accuse the club of being greedy. morris says he should have been offered a 33.50 seat. it would have been just 22.50 had he inquired earlier, but the price went up because of brisk demand.still, the game didn t reach the sellout that would open standing - room spaces. according to espn s crowd - tracking website, the senators have been operating at an average 95.4 capacity this season. their arena has 19,153 seats and a maximum of 1,347 standing - room spots, some along the top rail and others in private boxes.senators ticket prices are the lowest of canada s nhl teams, morris points put, with 3,000 seats remaining available wednesday for upcoming games at just 22.50 to 25.50.the club contacted cybulski this week to better explain the pricing policy. i know that he s a taller gentleman, so we did mention that if he prefers to be standing, we could make that happen, morris reports.cybulski says he appreciated the call but doesn t want preferential treatment. i like to think of myself as a little guy who fights for the little guy, he notes, though at six - foot - five, he s clearly speaking figuratively.one fight was before the ontario human rights tribunal, where he successfully argued that he should not have been denied top - secret security clearance to work as a commissionaire at a government agency because of his religious objection to armed conflict. he s still trying to overturn an order that kept the name of the agency secret.cybulski works for his father s carpentry company, when work is available, and takes the bus to hockey games, stopping at costco for a hotdog and drink to avoid high concession prices. not having much money, he says, gave him a connection last year with his fellow standees who, like the standing - room fans of old, had no lack of enthusiasm. just simple, working - class people, he says, they wanted to go out and enjoy the evening and support the team if they could.

2015-01-01,Ottawa Uber drivers head to court Jan. 28 to fight bylaw charge,"a pair of uber drivers plans to take charges of breaking the city of ottawa s taxi bylaw to provincial offences court later this month, according to a city of ottawa official.two individuals were charged with providing taxi service without a ottawa taxicab driver license on october 4. both contesting are the 615 fine levied against each of them for breaking the bylaw, said susan jones, ottawa s manager of emergency and protective services. their court date is set for january 28.the city said in september that uber drivers, who use their own vehicles to shuttle passengers around, need to be licensed as such and that their cars be licensed as taxis.uber, a you.s. company operating in 250 cities worldwide, maintains it s a technology company, not a taxi company, because its smartphone app connects freelance drivers with people who need a ride for a fee, rather than operating as a traditional taxi dispatch service. therefore, uber says, taxi laws don t apply to its business.uber ottawa warned customers on twitter that , when the normal price of the ride increases due to heightened demand, would likely be in effect on new year s eve. uber has attracted some criticism for its surge prices, but the company says that more lucrative rates for uber drivers at peak times encourages more people to get behind the wheel, bringing the price down again. there definitely was a surge in pricing on new year s eve, said uber spokesman xavier van chau.licensed taxis in ottawa have set, metered fares, regardless of demand.instagram user mattonm posted a photo of an uber that had been estimated at 16 to 22, but in the end it was 184.43. twitter user lindsaywhites from centretown to byward market.uber does require riders to agree beforehand to surge pricing.uber ottawa responded to those users online, asking them to send a copy of their receipt so they could look into it. we ll look into those items individually and assess if something wasn t done correctly, said van chau.undercover bylaw officers were monitoring and booking rides through the uber app on new year s eve as part of an ongoing effort to collect evidence against repeat drivers, jones said. she said the city would be evaluating the data in the coming days to determine who should be getting fined. part of our investigation is to monitor, over several days, to get repeat drivers who are creating problems, jones said.van chau said in an email statement that the city was acting against the wishes of ottawa residents. the sentiment among ottawans is clear reducing drunk driving and providing people with a reliable transportation alternative is a far higher safety priority than misguided sting operations, especially at times when conventional options fall short, van chau wrote.comments and an suggest that some ottawa residents think there are more important issues for the city to be tackling, and that uber helps reduce drunk driving incidents.van chau also noted that we ll support all of our drivers through any bylaw court cases, but he did not elaborate on what that support would look like.as for the new year s eve crack down, jones couldn t say exactly how many uber drivers bylaw officers were watching on wednesday night.she said the city increases its monitoring on days when they expect there to be a lot of uber activity. for example, bylaw officers will likely be out on january 4, when the senators play the tampa bay lightning."

2015-01-01,Taking U.S. off permanent war footing difficult to achieve,"taking america off a permanent war footing is proving harder than president barack obama may have suggested, the writes.here is the rest of the article you.s. troops are back in iraq, the endgame in afghanistan is requiring more troops and perhaps more risks than once expected and obama is saddled with a worsening, high - stakes conflict in syria.last spring, obama described to newly minted army officers at west point how the landscape has changed after a decade of war. he cited then - dwindling conflicts in iraq and afghanistan. and he said osama bin laden, whose plotting from an al - qaida sanctuary in afghanistan gave rise to what became america s longest war, is no more. you are the first class to graduate since 9 11 who may not be sent into combat in iraq or afghanistan, obama declared to a burst of applause.but once again the landscape has changed.once again the you.s. is engaged in combat in iraq not by soldiers on the ground but by pilots in the sky. and the pentagon is putting boots on the ground to retrain and advise iraqi soldiers how to fight a new menace the islamic state militants who emerged from the iraq insurgency that you.s. troops fought from 2003 - 2011.once again there are worsening crises demanding you.s. military intervention, including in syria. four months after his speech at the you.s. military academy, obama authorized american pilots, joined by arab allies, to begin bombing islamic state targets with the aim of undermining the group s base and weakening its grip in iraq.and once again the you.s. is on a path that could expand or prolong its military role in afghanistan. the you.s. combat role there ends december 31, but obama has authorized remaining you.s. troops to attack the taliban if they pose a threat to you.s. military personnel who are training afghan security forces for at least the next two years.at his final news conference of 2014, obama spoke just 18 words on afghanistan, saying, in less than two weeks, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in afghanistan will be over. as of december 16, a total of 2,215 you.s. troops had died in afghanistan and 19,945 had been wounded. in iraq, 4,491 died and 32,244 wounded.shortly before the invasion of iraq in 2003, obama, then an illinois state senator, called it a dumb war. he warned of unforeseen costs and consequences, arguing that president george w. bush would be smarter to finish what he started in afghanistan.obama s promise to end the war in iraq was a key to winning the white house in 2008. he delivered on that promise, but the war was not really over. events conspired to pull obama back in. in january 2014 the islamic state group seized the sunni city of fallujah, scene of the bloodiest fighting of the you.s. war a decade earlier.in june, the militants expanded their offensive, sweeping across much of northern iraq and capturing key cities, including mosul. whole divisions of the iraqi army folded, abandoning tanks and other american - supplied war equipment. that was not just a boon to the militants. it was a blow to you.s. prestige.suddenly, inexplicably, baghdad seemed within the islamic state group s reach.two months later obama gave the go - ahead for you.s. airstrikes in iraq. he ruled out sending ground combat forces, but at some point next year may face another tough choice whether to allow you.s. military advisers to accompany iraqi ground forces as they launch counteroffensives, including an expected push to retake mosul. up to now, you.s. advisers have been coordinating with iraqi forces from a safer distance.as obama approaches the end of his sixth year in office, he awaits congress formal endorsement of his new war against islamic state militants. the administration wants a legal basis for the war, known as an authorization for use of military force, rather than continuing to rely on congressional resolutions granted after 9 11 to justify the invasion of afghanistan, wage the iraq war and pursue al - qaida elsewhere.obama insists he has kept his word to end america s big wars, the occupations and nation - building efforts that began with such promise in both afghanistan and iraq but ultimately defied you.s. hopes for clear victories.in his speech december 15 at fort dix, n.j., obama said 90 percent of the troops that were deployed to war zones when he took office are now home. the time of deploying large numbers of ground forces with big military footprints to engage in nation - building overseas that s coming to an end, he said. going forward, our military will be leaner but ready for a range of missions. this era of you.s. wars began in afghanistan. on october 7, 2001, less than a month after teams of terrorists hijacked you.s. airliners and flew them into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon, america invaded afghanistan to root out al - qaida and topple its host, the taliban.by the time obama took office in january 2009 the you.s. had 34,400 troops in afghanistan, according to pentagon records. he tripled the total, to 100,000, in 2010 in a bid to turn the tide and defeat the taliban. that aim was never achieved; the taliban took a heavy pounding in 2010 - 2011, but it remains a force to be reckoned with, in part because of sanctuaries it enjoys in neighboring pakistan.the number of you.s. troops in afghanistan has dropped to a bit more than 11,000 from about 38,500 in january. but obama s original plan to go down to 9,800 by the end of this year and limit forces to advising the afghans and only fighting al - qaida not the taliban has changed.about 1,000 additional you.s. troops will remain in afghanistan for a few months to fill in for other coalition forces that washington hopes will arrive by spring 2015. the you.s. will continue to target taliban insurgents who threaten either afghans or americans."

2015-01-01,Veterans Affairs alleges some ex-soldiers exaggerating their injuries,"the veterans affairs department says some veterans are exaggerating their injuries to continue receiving financial benefits from the government and to avoid joining the work force.the explosive allegation is contained in a recent internal report on a veterans affairs rehabilitation program designed to help injured ex - soldiers transition to civilian life, which found thousands of veterans are staying in the program much longer than anticipated or not finishing it at all.the claim is sure to spark fresh anger among veterans groups and opposition critics who have previously complained about an insurance company attitude when it comes to veterans affairs canada s treatment of veterans.but veterans affairs minister julian fantino s office, asked about the report, said this week the government will continue to support injured veterans as long as they require assistance. our government makes no apologies for ensuring that veterans receive urgent rehabilitation care when they need it, and that they receive this support for as long as they and their medical practitioner deem appropriate, fantino spokeswoman ashlee smith said in an email.ndp veterans affairs critic peter stoffer was critical of the department s emphasis on potential abuse. in my experience, the vast majority of veterans don t want to be sick. they would love to be working full time. i think they re trying to shift the blame for the problems they have in their own program. nearly 1,000 injured veterans enrolled in the rehabilitation program when it was created in 2006, according to the report. demand was expected to drop off over the following years, but more than 5,800 vets were enrolled in the rehab program in march 2013, and 9,100 are expected by 2018.in a background briefing with the citizen this week, a veterans affairs official attributed the growth to pent - up demand among veterans who had served after the korean war. but the report also shows that veterans, once they are in the program, aren t leaving.more than 2,800 of the 5,800 veterans in the program at the end of march 2013 had been participating longer than originally expected, the report found. in fact, of the nearly 1,000 who originally joined in 2006, nearly one - third were still enrolled.reviewers who prepared the report acknowledged some problems with the program. they found weaknesses in determining veterans needs, including delays in consultations with health care professionals. and only 28 per cent of veterans who sought help finding a job actually landed a career they wanted.they also found the department had little information about how the program was actually functioning because it relied almost exclusively on voluntary surveys filled out by participants. this, they suggested, opened it up to abuse. research indicates respondents may inflate the incidence and severity of health problems and disability in order to rationalize labour force non - participation and or receipt of disability benefits, the report said.meanwhile, only 22 per cent of the 5,800 injured vets in the program were taking advantage of services to help them find a civilian job. part of this was because about about 32 per cent were receiving similar assistance from national defence.but a full 30 per cent were deemed currently unsuitable for such help or simply had no interest. the remaining 16 per cent were veterans determined to be too ill or injured to find gainful employment. that number has tripled since 2011 which reviewers noted coincided with a hike in cash benefits for injured ex - soldiers.the reviewers concluded that veterans were not very successful in meeting their employment goals. furthermore, the financial benefits available to injured veterans may be deterring veterans from actively participating in the vocational aspects of the program and the labour force. veterans affairs canada spokeswoman kate murphy said the department is working to develop new data collection tools and methodologies for measuring veteran outcomes. stoffer acknowledged that in any group of people, there will be those who abuse the system. but he said veterans are in close contact with health professionals, and he accused the department of finding excuses and blaming the victims rather than fixing the system. lberthiaume ottawacitizen.comtwitter.com leeberthiaume"
2015-01-01,Five Takes: The Senators Financial Future and The History of Mishaps,"happy new year, bryan murray, pierre dorion and randy lee. hope you spent some time sharpening your pencils and putting new batteries in the calculator.there s some tough negotiating ahead. as of thursday, they could begin talks on contract extensions with all of their pending young restricted free agents.for all the criticism owner eugene melnyk has received as a penny - pincher the senators should leapfrog calgary into 29 in overall 2014 - 15 salary cap spending when a defenceman is promoted from binghamton this weekend the picture will look considerably different in 2015 - 16. the senators already rank 15 in the nhl in 2015 - 16 spending they re committed to 54.257 million, including the start of bobby ryan s seven - year, 51.25 million contract extension and their young talents are in line for big raises. and what will the senators do with unrestricted free agency looming for marc methot and erik condra in a new year s edition of five takes, the citizen looks at the future financial picture, the upcoming schedule and a look back at normal everyday events which turned into major injury mishaps for the senators.the entry level deals to mika zibanejad, mark stone, alex chiasson and jean - gabriel pageau expire this season. in one respect, their options are limited. see below .mike hoffman is another case altogether. he owns salary arbitration rights, meaning he s in position to weigh his numbers against his teammates and his nhl peers. at this point, the stats look awfully good. he has 11 goals, scoring, on average, one goal every three games. he s tied with clarke macarthur for the team lead. he s tied for third among nhl rookies in goals and he s fourth in overall scoring.his one - year, two - way contract 750,000 in the big leagues, 150,000 in the american hockey league was an intriguing deal, protecting both sides.how sharp do the senators look now by not putting hoffman on waivers at the end of training camp how many other nhl teams are kicking themselves for not claiming hoffman when the senators put him on waivers the previous october as for the other pending restricted free agents, none have the numbers to attempt a ryan johansen - type holdout scenario. the nasty negotiations between the columbus blue jackets centre and management ended when he signed a three - year, 12 million contract, including 6 million in the final season.the senators, however, face the always tricky question of short - term contracts versus long - term extensions with zibanejad, stone and chiasson.often, players choose to sign two - year deals, setting themselves up for a bigger payday when they re allowed to become unrestricted free agents.the alternative is for the longer deal where teams pay their young talent more per season while buying out years of free agency.for pageau, the longer he stays in the big leagues the senators will face another tough decision when curtis lazar returns from the world junior tournament next week the better his chances of securing a guaranteed nhl contract next season.as methot recovers from his mysterious backside injury, he and the senators are keeping their fingers crossed that the worst is behind him pun intended . the sooner methot can find his old form, likely playing alongside erik karlsson, the better the senators will be in their hunt for a wild card spot.methot needs to re - establish himself for his own financial future. the injury pushed his nasty training camp contract fight with the senators into the background, but it will re - surface as the march 2 trade deadline approaches. if the senators are out of the race, they ll certainly consider trade options for the pending unrestricted free agent. if they re in the hunt for the post - season, with methot playing a key role, the dynamics change considerably.in the short - term, with methot and mark borowiecki on the sidelines, alex grant has a shot at a recall from binghamton, having raised eyebrows with solid play in the past month. grant brought in the new year with a gordie howe hat trick in a 6 - 2 win over lehigh valley wednesday.the senators have been sitting idle watching the gap between them and a wild card spot grow. on saturday, there will be pivotal points in play during a matinee against boston. the bruins are ahead by five points, but the senators have played two fewer games.to reach 93 points, generally considered the cut off line for the playoffs in the east, the senators need to pick up an average of 1.21 points for every remaining game slightly more than six points from every five games and 12 points from every 10 games.after sunday s home game against tampa, the senators face an intriguing road stretch where they need to win, but they can t directly take points away from teams ahead of them in the standings. the trip to philadelphia, colorado, phoenix and dallas features teams outside the playoffs. before thursday s games, philadelphia was eight points out of the post - season, jason spezza and dallas were six points back, colorado was nine points away and arizona was a distant 13 points behind.it also figures to be a scouting bonanza, playoff - bound teams checking out the talent. many of those scouting eyes will be trained on centre antoine vermette, the former senator who has 10 goals and 15 assists with arizona and is due to become an unrestricted free agent.as borowiecki described the gruesome details of the electrical outlet attack while playing indoor soccer earlier this week 48 stitches in three layers around his left shin and calf muscles it brought to mind a few of the other crazy incidents which have sidelined senators players over the years. goaltender craig anderson endured the attack of the frozen chicken in 2012, slicing his hand while attempting to prepare a post - game snack. back in 2009, hard - luck goaltender pascal leclaire fractured his cheekbone in the attack of the errant puck, when an attempted pass deflected off the glass behind the senators bench and off his face. in 1999, ron tugnutt, yet another ex -

2015-01-01,A happier future for Peaches the piglet (with video),"two days into her winter vacation, chelsey donohue was bored and found herself browsing through online ads when she came across a photo of a piglet, pointy - eared, staring up at the camera, being sold for meat. i had to save her, donohue said.she called the farm to inquire and learned that the little pig was bottle - fed and perks her ears when she s trying to get attention. she s more like a dog than a pig. i couldn t let her get eaten. donohue, 27, went to the farm two days before christmas. she paid 100 for the 39 - kilogram piglet, then picked up supplies to set her up temporarily at her mother s hobby farm in arnprior. she named the pig peaches.an ottawa bylaw prohibits pigs, or even - toed ungulates, from being kept in the city, and donohue knew her landlord wouldn t approve, so she reached out to the community for support to help find peaches a home before she heads back to her civil service job on january 5.a swift response from catherine landry and jessica laframboise of the ladies who lunch group and micheline masson of help ottawa fur kids found peaches a home at a sanctuary farm in kemptville. then they began raising money to cover the pig s food and other costs for the charity - based farm.masson said they ve already surpassed the 400 goal, and more is being sent directly to the sanctuary.big sky ranch has been rescuing animals since 2002 and is taking peaches on saturday.andy parent founded the sanctuary and says he has about 95 animals on the farm horses, dogs, pot - belly pigs, buffalo, emus, and lamas, to name a few.peaches will fit right in with this eclectic group.parent said peaches is a market pig, or a meat pig, and she ll going to grow to about 275 kg. they usually live to about a year, year - and - a half when the meat is still tender to become pork chops, he said. but on his farm, it s a no - kill zone.volunteers will try to set peaches up with an older, heavier, pig named lulu. lulu was rescued from a barn fire in petawawa four years ago. the hope is that lulu can be an adoptive mother. what we re going to do is slowly match peaches up with lulu so they can be friends. we ll obviously have to be careful, because right now peaches is just a baby and lulu weights about 800 pounds, parent said.for the next couple of days, donohue is enjoying her time with peaches. she takes her on walks with a dog leash, and feeds her avocado and bananas in her temporary stall. i ll miss her, but i like that she s going to a place where i can actually visit her, donohue said.that s one lucky pig."
2015-01-02,Baird slams 'provocative' action by Palestinian Authority,"the canadian government is condemning a move by the palestinian authority to join the international criminal court icc in a bid to eventually launch war - crimes prosecutions against israel.foreign affairs minister john baird says the action taken by palestinians this week is a concerning and dangerous development. such a provocative decision only furthers the divide between palestinians and israelis, and will carry unfortunate consequences, he said in a written statement. canada has expressed these concerns directly to the palestinian authority for nearly four years now. the conservative government s reaction comes as the world comes to grips with the potential implications of the palestinians move.after decades of conflict in the middle east during which peace talks between the palestinians and israelis went nowhere, canadians officials and political leaders worry this week s development could further sink hopes for a long - term solution.as well, there are already suggestions that the palestinians could bear the brunt of a backlash. the united states congress may cut 400 million in funding to the palestinians.it is expected the palestinian authority will formally join the icc in 60 days. however, if they persuade the court to investigate israel for war crimes, it s also possible perhaps likely that the palestinians themselves would be investigated for the alleged war crimes of hamas.ndp foreign affairs critic paul dewar said in an interview friday that the palestinian bid for icc membership is understandable and entirely legal , but nonetheless represents a ramping up of tensions that isn t helpful to the goal of getting a negotiated settlement. this isn t going to solve the quagmire that we see between the israelis and the palestinians. it doesn t lead to what we want to see, which is the creation of a state of palestine with recognition from the israelis. liberal foreign affairs critic marc garneau said friday the palestinians unilateral action gets in the way of a two - state solution. i think it sends a signal which is counter - productive. they are free to apply but i think it is a mistake on their part and will only make the situation worse by entrenching positions, said garneau. what is good for the goose is good for the gander. there will also be, i m sure, some concerted efforts to show that hamas is guilty of war crimes. and so what we ll get into is a very long and very unfortunate situation. on friday, the palestinians took their formal step to submit documents to join the icc. afterwards, riyad mansour, the chief palestinian observer at the united nations, said they seek to raise alleged crimes by israel, including during last summer s war in gaza, and to seek justice for the war crime associated with israeli settlements on palestinian territory. this is a very significant step, said mansour. it is an option that we are seeking in order to seek justice for all the victims that have been killed by israel, the occupying power. earlier this week, the palestinian authority under the leadership of president mahmoud abbas put forward a controversial resolution, introduced on its behalf by jordan, at the united nations security council.the resolution set a one - year deadline for negotiations with israel, established targets for palestinian sovereignty with east jerusalem as its capital, and called for the withdrawal of israel forces in the west bank by the end of 2017.the resolution needed nine votes in the 15 - member security council to be adopted. it received eight votes.the next day, a frustrated abbas called the media to his headquarters in the west bank and signed papers the rome statute as part of an application to join the icc.the icc was established in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. it has 122 members, including canada and much of western europe, but not israel or the united states.the palestinians are confident their application for icc membership will be granted, given that in 2012 the un general assembly upgraded palestine to a non - member observer state. there is no guarantee, however, that the court based in the hague would investigate palestinian allegations of war crimes.israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu reacted angrily, saying the icc should not accept the palestinian authority because it is not a state. he said the palestinian government includes hamas which, like isis, commits war crimes.by contrast, he said the israelis have a moral army that upholds international law, signalling that his country would defend members of the military if an investigation ever occurs.in washington, the you.s. state department called the palestinian move an escalatory step that is entirely counter - productive to hopes for a peace deal.canadian government policy as stipulated on the foreign affairs department website is critical of israel s settlements on the west bank as being illegal. but prime minister stephen harper s government has been a steadfast ally of israel, and harper and baird have refused specifically to speak about the settlements. during a trip to the region a year ago, the prime minister said he wasn t going to single out israel for its actions.they say they are encouraging israel and the palestinian authority to find a two - state solution to their long - standing conflict.mkennedy ottawacitizen.comtwitter.com mark kennedy "
2015-01-02,Letter: Wartime acceptance,"re , december 29.thank you for the series of christmas war letters from soldiers overseas in the first world war. my soul was both saddened and nourished by their thoughts, feelings and faith.one letter from christmas 1918 referred to the spanish flu epidemic. it reminded me of something my dad told us.my father was pte. eber w. robinson, reg. 3325075, of marvelville, ont. he was still in training at the end of the war, stationed at the seaside base at seaford, southeast england. he used to tell us of one assignment given to him and his mates for weeks if not months after the armistice was signed. they were marched out each morning to the local cemeteries to dig graves for the victims of the flu.sometimes i visualize them, athletic young men, marching along a country lane a platoon or section, depending on the number of graves to be dug that day, their boots polished, their uniforms pressed and their brass buttons gleaming. over their shoulders would be slung, not a rifle, but a spade or pickax. in late afternoon their return would be obvious for all to see, their uniforms white from the chalk in which they had been digging, a ghostly sight ! dad told us the depth of any given grave was determined by the number in the family to be buried there. they buried caskets one on top of the other, rather than side by side, to conserve space. i assume the cemeteries provided the ladders, buckets and ropes for the task.other citizen readers may have similar stories to tell, not of heroism but of the acceptance of duty in a time of need."
2015-01-02,Ottawa Senators concentrate on getting 'stagnant' power play going,"boston before leaving town on friday, the ottawa senators spent most of their practice time tuning up their power play.with good reason. over their past four games, the senators are 0 - for - 13 with the man advantage. even more frightening, heading into a game in boston the senators had produced at a 13.8 - per - cent clip in road games.overall, the senators rank 19th in the nhl in power - play production at 18.1 per cent, ever so slightly behind the bruins 18th - ranked unit at 18.2 per cent. at home, though, the bruins have one of the league s most potent power plays, with a 27.3 - per - cent success rate, eclipsing their paltry 9.1 - per - cent production away from home.look for the senators to try to get their hot scorer, bobby ryan, open for a shot on the power play. at practice, they used ryan higher in the slot, at times on the point.i moved bobby ryan up on the flank on his off side, said head coach dave cameron. i think bobby is a pure passer, but he can score from up there, it s a different look. so, basically he s gone into mike hoffman s spot. hopefully a new start again with some new units and new looks and playing the point a little bit for myself, you just hope it is a refreshing change, ryan said.in another tweak, centre david legwand is taking up residence near the opposition net to provide a screen.both ryan and cameron used the word stagnant to describe ottawa s power play. too much standing around. in fact, when it comes to new year s resolutions, good health and a more energetic power play are atop cameron s list.we get too many shots blocked, not on the net enough, cameron said of the power play. and we don t shoot the puck enough off the pass. we have to handle the pass, and that just gives penalty killers time to adjust. those are the three things i d like to see change. finally, defenceman marc methot will play a game for the senators it s just not the ottawa senators. on saturday, methot is scheduled to suit up for a conditioning stint with the ahl binghamton senators in a home game against the syracuse crunch. methot skated with the nhl senators on friday in preparation for his rehab stint.as to when methot could return to ottawa s lineup, it s anyone s guess. the hope is he could be ready next week, as long as he doesn t have a setback with his back hip injury.my concern is his fitness level, cameron said. you can t fast - forward fitness. there will be so many factors going into that decision of his nhl return . i just hope he stays healthy. methot, who was injured before the season started, has played just twice this season on december 4 and december 6. since going back to rehabilitation for the injury, he has taken a longer - term approach, and feels he has more explosiveness than he has all season.i just feel way more comfortable, and i m in a better mood because of it when i m out there on the ice, methot said, during his december 31 media availability.never mind a trade upgrade. getting a healthy methot would be the equivalent of acquiring a top - pairing defenceman, not to mention a proven partner for erik karlsson.for insurance, the senators will recall a defenceman from binghamton. cameron said the decision on which defenceman to promote will be made following the b - sens friday road game. whoever it is won t play for ottawa unless there is an injury to one of the six starters.asked what type of defenceman he wants, cameron said i want their best player. the wheels were spinning in fan circles when centre j.g. pageau moved onto bobby ryan s line, with mike hoffman, to help ignite ryan s three - goal night against the buffalo sabres monday.and while cameron liked what he saw from that line in that game, he didn t hesitate to keep mika zibanejad between ryan and hoffman in friday s line rushes. pageau reverts to his third - line role between alex chiasson and milan michalek.cameron says he still likes the big - centre presence of zibanejad over the long haul, and dismissed the buffalo performance as an off - game by zibanejad.i don t know if i ever change things completely based on one game, but now it gives you a bit of thought, cameron said. pageau showed he could move up in the lineup for a short period of time. it s always nice to have options. senators winger mark stone, 22, says he s looking forward to facing his 24 - year - old brother, michael, when the senators visit arizona for a game january 11. it will be the first time the pair have played against each other since their junior days in the whl. i played him a ton in junior, two playoff series. one in the american league, mark stone said. he said his brother is not much into chirping, but the two were known to come close to blows after their junior games.stone said losing to one s brother wouldn t sting as much when both are in the nhl."

2015-01-02,Police union president says shootings a symptom of understaffed force,"the president of the union representing ottawa police officers says that a hiring freeze that the chief of police is intent on continuing is part of the because of a record - year for gun violence in ottawa. we re at a point where we re so stretched for resources, starting from patrol and moving all the way through the organization, that it s so difficult to accomplish proactive policing, said president matt skof. you re in a position where you re always just reacting to the call. a recent report by the fraser institute called the forces in ottawa and gatineau the third - most understaffed in the country. it s not just patrol that is short. it s all the sections that are short. all these sections have bodies dedicated to other projects, to other areas, and it s because of that that we re seeing this difficulty in managing the resources that we have because they re so tight, skof said. the squeeze is on everyone. and in that situation, the union says policing becomes reactive.the force has said they ve increased patrols and will be briefing patrol and neighbourhood officers on shootings and gang activity. the service continues to reiterate that there is no bigger concern for city police right now than gang - related shootings. detectives have been moved from other investigative units to the guns and gangs section for an indeterminate period, but that leaves many wondering what will happen to the sections and jobs they re leaving behind with their own important workloads.the union contends that although the population of ottawa has grown, that growth hasn t been reflected by an expansion of the service. instead, a five - year hiring freeze is expected to extend into the new year after chief charles bordeleau said the force would scrap plans to hire 15 new officers and eight civilians in order to absorb growth so that the force can produce a budget that comes in under mayor jim watson s proposed cap of a two - per - cent tax increase.the service is attempting to balance a limited increase against a retroactive 2.5 - per - cent pay increase awarded to rank - and - file officers in both 2013 and 2014. bargaining for a 2015 contract has yet to begin.coun. diane deans has urged bordeleau to meet with city council and make a case for what resources the police service needs.coun. rick chiarelli has also gone on record saying that council will weigh additional funding if bordeleau can prove it s necessary.earlier this week, concerned about the spate of shootings and what it might be a symptom of internally, skof approached city councillors asking each to either meet with him privately or together as a group to give them the association s perspective on the problems plaguing the service and what skof called a political squeeze on the police budget. from my perspective, we do need to have growth.

2015-01-02,Plasco misses 3rd deadline to find financing for waste plant,"plasco energy has missed another deadline set by the city to prove it has secured the financing it needs to build a waste - to - energy plant in ottawa by 2016.the company had until december 31 to meet its financial commitments under a 20 - year, multimillion - dollar contract with the city, but failed to deliver. plasco has missed similar deadlines on two previous occasions.that means the city now has the power to terminate the contract at its own discretion. that s a decision that committee and council needs to make, city manager kent kirkpatrick told the citizen on friday.kirkpatrick met with plasco ceo ray floyd about two weeks ago and told him then that the subject matter and option to terminate the contact would be discussed in a staff report to be submitted in advance of the first environment committee meeting of 2015, scheduled for feb 17.that means the report would be released publicly on february 10, when the committee s agenda is posted on the city s website.kirkpatrick said he told the company to provide the city with any pertinent information including details about whether it can secure financing by the end of january. that would be information that would be very important with respect to that decision, he said.kirkpatrick added plasco is still very bullish about its prospects.company spokesman edmond chiasson said friday that plasco is at a critical stage for the commercialization of its technology in ottawa. the city has been very patient with us and we re going to continue to work with them, he said. our view has been the best place for us to build our first full commercial plant is ottawa. that remains our view. we thought we could pull it all together in 2014, didn t quite get it there, chiasson said.he wouldn t say whether a financing deal was imminent, but noted plasco representatives will be at the february 17 environment committee meeting to bring councillors up to speed on the company s plans. the city s been fair to us in the past, we re confident or hopeful they ll be fair to us in the future, chiasson said.plasco must also advise the city of any other changes it would require in the contract before the end of january, such as a proposal to build a smaller facility, kirkpatrick said.its design changes include a reduction in plant size, an inclusion of a drying and cooling system, a change in stormwater management, and a reduction in engines from 10 to seven, according to the ministry of the environment.kirkpatrick said in december that the company informed the city that it had revised its designs into what plasco believes is a more cost - effective configuration. for example, plasco plans to build fewer processing strings, or production units, but each with greater capacity than the previous design. still, kirkpatrick said in december, the overall processing capacity could drop to 250 tonnes per day from 3oo, although the company has not provided the city with those specifics.the contract that council agreed to in december 2011 called for a 300 - tonne - a - day gasification plant. meanwhile, in august 2013 when council agreed to extend plasco s deadline to dec 31, 2014 councillors also approved a motion that directed staff to immediately commence a request for expressions of interest process for alternative technologies to handle the city s residual waste should plasco not meet the requirements of the agreement by the end of 2014.kirkpatrick said friday the city will proceed with this interest - gathering exercise, the results of which will also be included in the february 17 report to the environment committee.it s worth noting why the city went down this road in the first place.council wants to reduce the city s reliance on the trail road landfill, so it has taken measures to divert as much material as possible by implementing recycling programs and introducing green bins for organic waste.but because some residual waste can t be diverted and the lifespan of the landfill isn t infinite, council opted to explore some higher - value propositions in terms of what to do with the waste, kirkpatrick said. it makes sense not just from an environmental policy perspective but from an economic perspective to look for lower cost alternatives to exhausting the capacity that we currently have remaining, and having to replace it, he said. s plasma gasification process is designed to turn residential garbage into electricity, water, and a glassy leftover slag."
2015-01-02,Conservative MPs take sides in Ontario PC leadership race,"longtime ontario pc mpp christine elliott, the party s former deputy leader, is widely considered the frontrunner and has been racking up endorsements from more than a dozen federal conservative mps, including cabinet ministers rob nicholson, chris alexander, kellie leitch and ed holder.endorsements from mps are important for recruiting volunteers, selling all - important memberships and rounding up donations to keep the campaigns running up to the may 9, 2015 leadership convention in toronto.backbench conservative mp patrick brown who has deep roots in the ontario pcs, including previously serving as party vice - president is also quickly rounding up endorsements from mps and senators.brown says he has the support of more than 40 total mps, and has so far identified about a dozen ontario conservative mps backing him. they include cabinet minister bal gosal and a handful of federal parliamentary secretaries, such as paul calandra, the parliamentary secretary to prime minister stephen harper. several senators also are supporting his campaign. i am honoured with the heavy federal involvement and support of my campaign, brown, 36, told the citizen. the provincial party is broken. it doesn t need to be tweaked. it needs to be rebuilt. i am not the candidate of the same - old, same - old. i am the candidate that plans to rebuild the party into a real grassroots organization like the federal party. elliott met with several supportive tory mps in ottawa in december for a question - and - answer session hosted by mp erin o toole, parliamentary secretary to the international trade minister.o toole has been longtime friends of elliott and her late husband, former federal finance minister jim flaherty. o toole said elliott, who finished third in the 2009 pc leadership won by tim hudak, offers a clean break from the former leader and valuable experience at queen s park. the pc party of ontario right now needs a leader that is experienced in provincial politics, has real private sector experience and knows how the economy functions, small business and big business. but more importantly, someone that also understands the challenges families face, o toole said in an interview. christine fits all of those categories and probably has more experience than any potential premier on all those fronts in ontario s history. federal conservatives supporting elliott along with cabinet ministers nicholson, alexander, leitch and holder also include toronto - area mp and former cabinet minister peter kent, wellington - halton hills mp michael chong, oakville mp terence young and burlington mp mike wallace.o toole said he has been good friends with brown for years, but feels elliott is the better leader for the provincial party at this point.ontario mps endorsing brown include rick dykstra, costas menegakis, gordon brown, dean allison, joe daniel and others. brown said that other cabinet ministers from outside the province have been helping him on the campaign.as examples, justice minister peter mackay and minister of state for small business maxime bernier have headlined major fundraisers for his campaign, brown noted.brown, who chairs the federal conservatives gta caucus, has been criss - crossing ontario for months as part of his pc leadership campaign, sparking questions about whether he s able to fulfil his mp duties at the same time.however, the barrie mp said he hasn t missed any regional caucus meetings since the leadership race started and continues to keep a busy federal calendar, including sitting on parliamentary groups and all - party caucuses, and hosting charity events in his riding.both elliott and brown expect to announce more mp endorsements this month.the ontario pcs under hudak suffered a stinging defeat to premier kathleen wynne s liberals in the june 2014 election. hudak resigned his post a few weeks later and has been replaced by jim wilson on an interim basis until a new leader is selected in may.elliott, brown and ontario tory mpps vic fedeli, lisa macleod and monte mcnaughton are all vying to lead the pcs into the next election.macleod, the mpp for nepean - carleton, has not yet announced any mp endorsements for her campaign, but has won the backing of conservative sen. bob runciman, a former mpp and interim leader of the ontario pcs.ontario pc members will vote by preferential ballot on either may 3 or may 7, 2015, with the results announced may 9."

fashioned historical romances brimming with war and love and exotic, long - ago locales. at least, that s what head of zeus is betting.the publisher has just re - issued, in both print and e - book form, zemindar by ottawa author valerie fitzgerald. originally released in 1981, the award - winning saga stretches more than 800 pages as it accompanies laura hewitt, a young and principled brit who journeys to india and becomes swept up in the india mutiny of 1857 including the bloody siege of lucknow. the mutiny by sepoys, or indian soldiers, was against the east india company, the british trading company army which basically ran india at the time, and was eventually quelled.the book, often mentioned in the same breath as m.m kaye s popular epic the far pavilions, opens in leisurely fashion with laura s sea voyage to india as the paid companion to her vapid cousin emily. once there, laura meets the handsome and rich oliver erskine who is zemindar, or hereditary ruler, of a fiefdom named hassanganj. a relationship and the mutiny, both tumultuous, ensue.fitzgerald is not given to overstatement about the reissue of her engrossing book. i call it my retread, says the 87 - year - old author in the living room of her unassuming ottawa home. she s pleased by the publisher s decision, but i don t know what response it will get. it s a very different world now. fitzgerald knows whereof she wrote. born and raised in india by british parents, she came from a family well - acquainted with the subcontinent. her grandmother lived through the indian mutiny. her father served with the british army in india and was the administrator of a large estate in the territory of oudh, an area embroiled in the mutiny.fitzgerald says that despite the pre - 1947 push for independence from britain, there was no ill - will between brits and nationals, at least not in the countryside where she lived. for example, her family had servants you can t do without servants when you live with no electricity, no running water , but the relationship was one of mutual respect. an elderly cook, she recalls, was pensioned off after five decades with a bit of land, a house and a cow.as a teen, fitzgerald lived near and explored the ruins of lucknow, 19 - century steel - engraved prints of which hang in her ottawa home. i d just get on my bicycle and take off and visit india all day. i was safe as houses. we had such freedom, she says.those were also the years when she was bitten by the writing bug. her only sibling didn t live in india, and her parents were often busy so fitzgerald, who had no interest in the club where others swam and played tennis, escaped into books like sir walter scott s historical novels. i had to become self - sufficient so i read and read, and then thought i d try writing. i learned the uses of loneliness there. she tried her hand several times at fiction none of it very good, she reports before finally settling down to write zemindar after she was married.like her father she loved british - indian history and that, combined with her intimate knowledge of the country, sparked the novel.some of the book she researched at trinity college, dublin where she moved during the mid - 1960s with her young family nothing if not well - travelled, she lived everywhere from kenya i wore a gun for three years during the mau mau rebellion to italy before her husband s job finally brought the family to canada in 1968 .for the central figure of laura, a kind of pre - feminism feminist, fitzgerald drew on her maternal grandmother with whom she was close as a youngster. she was an amazing character. she attended medical school, i think in edinburgh, for two years, but then her mother died and so she went out to india to look after all her little brothers and sisters. laura, she adds, is a strong character, not very sentimental, not very beautiful. she s like a lot of other women i hope. other people have told fitzgerald they see much of laura in her.for the other characters, she drew on real people she d discovered while researching her story.the physical appearance of oliver erskine the zemindar was based on a painting by goya of the young duke of wellington that fitzgerald spotted in a dublin newspaper. the ira a stolen the painting for ransom, and when fitzgerald spotted a photo of it in the paper, she thought, oh, that chap will do. i had no idea what oliver looked like until i saw the painting. it took fitzgerald about two years to write the book once she was in canada.the question, of course, is why she never wrote another. she poked away at a couple of ideas, but illnesses in the 1980s, a growing interest in watercolour painting and other events meant the ideas never bore fruit.she did, however, become a book reviewer for the washington post, the now - defunct ottawa journal and other papers.three decades after receiving largely positive reviews in the new york times and elsewhere, how does zemindar stand up in fitzgerald s eyes i m quite proud of it, believe it or not. there are some things i wouldn t do the same way, maybe. but it holds together pretty well. zemindarvalerie fitzgerald head of zeus "
2015-01-02,"Scanlan: Ryan, Senators know time is now to make up some ground","boston the ottawa senators rang in the first work day of the new year with a lengthy practice and a short flight.just like that, the senators begin 2015 with a sense of urgency a pair of weekend games that will surely go a long way toward deciding if there is a legitimate hope for a playoff push this spring. a lost weekend probably = a lost because.as the wheels lifted on a quick road trip to boston, the senators glanced at the nhl standings to find themselves with seven points plus the boston bruins and florida panthers standing between themselves and a wild - card position in the eastern conference. as gulfs to bridge go, not exactly the grand canyon, but formidable.i think my son can count to seven, so it s pretty easy to get there, goaltender craig anderson joked of the seven - point deficit. on paper, seven points seems a small enough gap to close. the hard math suggests that with three - point games and multiple teams to chase, the smallest margins can be elusive even before teams have reached the halfway mark of the season.when anderson stopped grinning about his young son s counting skills, he reminded us of the significance of so - called four - point games against divisional teams. after a tough matin e in boston saturday, the senators return home to face the first - place tampa bay lightning sunday. tampa bay made a pit stop in pittsburgh friday to wrestle penguins for the conference lead.to stay within a chip shot of the top eight teams, ottawa is going to need a productive weekend against two prominent division rivals, including a boston team it will need to pass in the standings.good on winger bobby ryan for honestly noting the reality of the situation.it s getting a little late for all the moral victories, ryan said. the last couple of weeks we ve outplayed teams and lost, we ve kept the pace in games and lost. now it s time to put those building blocks together last game was a step forward in the right direction. that game, of course, was a 5 - 2 victory over the buffalo sabres, way back in 2014, on december 29. ryan exploded with a hat trick.the last thing a goal scorer wants after a three - goal performance is a four - day break between games. but ryan has felt this personal hot streak approaching, like a long - lost friend.i feel really good, ryan says, after reaching 10 goals on the season. for a month - and - a - half, it seemed like i was guessing wrong or predicting wrong where the puck was going to go, and i was jumping to the wrong areas. i tried to simplify things and finally got rewarded for it. it s the age - old tale. you go back to basics and get to the net, and pucks will find you. anderson, meanwhile, has had some rough games in boston, and freely admits it. it helps explain the team s habit of using robin lehner in boston.my last one there might have been when seidenberg scored from centre ice, anderson said. just giving you guys some dirt to dig up on me. that was on january 31, 2011, as the senators coughed up a 3 - 1 lead to lose on dennis seidenberg s clapper from centre. anderson s most recent start here was equally grim, a 7 - 2 bruins win on february 8, 2014. anderson was relieved by lehner after the fifth goal.his bruins history aside, anderson likes what he has seen from the senators lately, including the december 13 shootout victory versus the bruins recorded by lehner.from my vantage point on the bench, why we had success there is we played hard, we played simple, we played for each other, anderson said. lately, we ve been giving ourselves an opportunity to win games. anderson tends to direct traffic in his own zone, but likes the way his teammates are finding their way as a unified group.everyone knows what everyone is doing, anderson says. everyone knows where they re supposed to be. when the puck goes to that spot, we re usually first on it because we know what s happening. that december 13 shootout victory at td garden was the first in the nhl for head coach dave cameron. a repeat would be sweet.we have to get points to get back in the race, and the sooner you get them, the better chance you have to build momentum, build confidence, cameron said before leaving ottawa. you pretty well deal with the same issues every day, but when you re winning, they just don t seem to be quite as magnified. people are more receptive. a bold start to the new year ryan figures the hockey club had its moment of renewal a couple of weeks ago when head coach paul maclean was replaced by cameron, an internal promotion.i guess that was the beginning of our changeover, right ryan says. but the slate does wipe clean and you get the chance to start 2015 with a positive. it would be a huge win to start the year.

2015-01-02,The thin blue Conservative line,"they scrutinize crowded rooms, sit backs to the wall, and instinctively hit the deck at the sound of guns blazing in the hall of honour.a dozen ex - cops occupy seats in the commons and senate, which is possibly a record.it s most certainly a thin blue line. all but one are tory mps and senators, from canadian heritage minister shelly glover, on leave from active duty as a winnipeg police officer, to alberta mp and former mountie jim eglinski, who took his commons seat this month.david wilks, a hulking mp from british columbia, spent two decades at rcmp outposts from new aiyansh to sparwood. he and his partner once waded into a rampaging crowd of 1,000 rioting youths trashing penticton to make an arrest.today, the verbal invective fired during question period is a comparative cake walk.conservative sen. vern white spent 31 years in police work, 11 as chief of police including five in ottawa and as a senior rcmp officer. his ability to walk the middle of the political road was important to succeed. so, yeah, the transition is tough, he says of politics.what s more, there s not a whole lot of people i ve disliked in my life. i ve investigated a fair number of homicides and i didn t dislike or hate those people. i might hate their act, but hating them was tough to do. but in politics, people dislike each other because of their politics. i find that challenging. that was a transition. neither the liberals or ndp count retired police officers in their ranks, though former liberal sen. larry campbell, now sitting as an independent, served in the rcmp. matthew mulcair, son of ndp leader tom mulcair, is a sergeant in the s ret du qu bec.the 11 - member conservative police fraternity serves as a family of sorts. a piece of them will always remain police officers. with three former chiefs of police, senior ex - mounties and decades of front - line experience, it would also be a seemingly strong law enforcement caucus for advice on government policy and legislation.yet while some members are consulted individually for a police perspective on matters, surprisingly the government doesn t often seek advice from the law enforcement caucus as a whole.likewise, the conservatives tough - on - crime agenda developed quite independently of the former officers in caucus. the law - and - order lineup is an obvious pull, but it s not the chief reason these lawmen became lawmakers.politics and policing have always been a complex symbiosis. similarities abound between the two and the personalities they attract.each organization is top - down and highly structured. yet individual members, whether in parliament or on the street, must be able to stand alone and defend themselves.everything is calculated. nothing moves forward, be it a government bill or a homicide charge, unless success seems assured.and the power each institution wields over society depends on public approval. corruption cannot be tolerated. that results in the policing of politics and the politics of policing.both jobs can be thankless, with frequent public criticism. even the vocabulary of one often echoes the other leadership, respect, responsibility, order, justice, community, protect, serve, punish.it s not surprising then there s a real natural flow and fit for law enforcement people in parliament, says yukon conservative mp ryan leef, 40. he s a one - time rcmp officer, former conservation officer, correctional centre deputy superintendent and cage fighter with a black belt in martial arts. it s nice to see that no matter what you do in life, there s always a home for it in politics. it would be a sad day if we didn t have a police officer standing among our parliamentary ranks. opposition to the long gun registry helped propel leef into politics. from both my law enforcement background and my own hobbies and habits of hunting and the outdoors, the public safety argument that we were hearing all those years when former liberal justice minister allan rock brought that in made no sense. it frustrated me we weren t getting the representation that i thought we deserved in our territory on it. you either live with the way something is going or you step up and do something about it. he won the conservative nomination and then the riding in 2011 by a razor - thin 132 votes over the then - liberal incumbent.as former peace officers, we ve already had years under our belts where you ve faced some of that abuse that comes in the public context and you ve already made peace with yourself and your ambition, he says. your ambition is not measured by a paycheque, by self - reward. your ambition is measured by what you can do every day for the people in your community. and there s probably no group that recognizes that as much in this environment as law enforcement. the jobs are similar in another way. policing is what you did; it s what you did, it s who you are. and it s no different as a politician, he says. i m the mp in the grocery store, i m the mp at the sports arena, i m the mp when i m at my son s christmas concert at school. it was the exact same in policing. wilks, 55, came to parliament in 2011 after 11 years in local b.c. politics and 20 years before that as a mountie in the province s rugged reaches. he s always had conservative blood. when incumbent tory mp jim abbott decided not to run in the 2011 federal election, wilks stepped up. i was, at the time, 49. the kids had all grown up and they d moved out, and we were having grandkids, and i went, if you re going to do it, now s the time. his biggest challenge is adjusting to parliamentary bureaucracy. it s like no other, he says. everything moves so slow compared to police work. a big reason wilks came to ottawa was to make a difference in justice issues. he now sits on the justice committee. the criminal code should not be getting bigger, he says. we should actually be trying to condense it and make it as simple as we can for police officers to use. it s got so muddled. his dream legislative reform one he admits will never happen would be to revisit the charter to somehow make it more police - friendly. we didn t seem to have that much of a problem pre - charter; we still respected people s rights, we still recognized that they had to be treated fairly, all of those things, he explains.but the interpretation of the charter all the time by the courts can make police work very difficult because we don t know from day to day whether we re going to breach something. new case law is created all the time. during my drug enforcement days, in penticton we were doing grow - ops every day. if a person had a residence on an acreage, you could enter the acreage but you couldn t go into the house. so you could potentially garner information such as hearing generators running, maybe get a whiff of the dope growing. then case law came out that you couldn t do that, that you had to stay off the property. so then we got to the point where we d flir it forward - looking infrared cameras, typically mounted on aircraft . then case law came out you can t invade their property from above. well, we re just trying to investigate something and you guys the courts are now telling us we can t do it, but you didn t tell us that it was wrong at the time . you re telling us it is wrong now. we re trying to figure out, where do we go what do we do what ends up happening a lot of the time is, to err on the side of caution, they won t do anything.

2015-01-02,Angelina Chapin: Resolutions and regrets,"in my first year of university, i made a poster with from sex and the city s carrie bradshaw as we drive along this road called life, occasionally a gal will find herself a little lost. and when that happens, i guess she has to let go of the coulda, shoulda, would have, buckle up and just keep going. i made the decorative choice during a period in which i also wore a housecoat and a full face of makeup to morning lectures. but behind my saccharine bubble letters, the modern proverb was a real reminder of one of my greatest weaknesses i m incredibly indecisive, and when i make a decision, i instantly second - guess myself.the switch from christmas to the new year feels like the moment lights turn on after a long night at the bar. without eggnog - coloured glasses, every pile of vomit and broken glass in our lives becomes visible. the personality flaws we ve been hiding behind fuzzy holiday sweaters begin to unravel in plain sight. in a panic, we make resolutions spend more time with aunt edna. be less judgemental. approach cheeseburgers with moderation.north american culture touts self - improvement as the key to happiness. but more of us would be happy if we simply embraced our flaws.the tony robbins brand of self - help does not work for everyone. motivational quotes, positive thinking and excessive goal - planning can have damaging effects for naturally pessimistic people. , author of the antidote happiness for people who can t stand positive thinking , found that when people try hard to ignore negativity, it s all they can think about. in his journey through the self - help world, burkeman discovered many contradictions. he writes in the new york times that often make people with low self - esteem feel worse but i m too ugly to deserve love ! . can lead to a false sense of achievement and rigid goal setting can turn humans into unethical monsters. it turns out the most useful new year s resolution is not to become more positive, but to hug your imperfections a little tighter.there s no need to pretend negativity doesn t exist to be happy. accepting difficult emotions such as anxiety and depression is in fact an excellent coping mechanism. meditate, they acknowledge negative thoughts and promptly let them go. the exercise turns the mind into a sturdy boat that won t capsize when life becomes rocky. sometimes, it s best for cynics to indulge their negative thoughts. obviously moderation is key. being oscar the grouch will land you a garbage can of a life. but has coined defensive pessimism as an effective strategy in certain situations. when an anxious person imagines a worst - case scenario i will forget my speech in front of 100 people , it motives him or her to take the necessary steps to succeed i will practise said speech 100 times . positive thinking, on the other hand, can act as little more than a reminder of expectations a person cannot fulfill.every personality flaw is also a strength. take my indecision for example. wants to slow down when faced with a difficult decision so it can toss information back and forth like pizza dough and arrive at a well - rounded conclusion. and because of my constant uncertainty, i let that process happen. whenever i make a decision it feels like i m conducting a mini - trial in which i argue for and against each choice, calling friends and family to the stand. impulsiveness short circuits that admittedly exhausting inquiry and often results in half - baked choices with lasting consequence. i may waste 20 minutes trying to decide on a brand of toothpaste and another 10 minutes second - guessing the one i buy but i have almost no long - term life regrets. my indecisiveness also stems from good aspects of my personality. because i care about people, i m overly sensitive to how a choice will affect anyone involved. because i m curious and open - minded, i always see a web of possibilities rather than a straight line.there s no doubt we should try and be happy. but rather than follow tony robbins and his ilk, we should see our flaws as secret weapons. now that i ve long since graduated from housecoat - clad student to a wise adult, i know those coulda, shoulda, wouldas are worth holding on to."

2015-01-02,Wartime advances in trauma care are coming back to help civilians,"he knew the homeowner possessed firearms, not that it worried him. in colorado, a police officer nervous to visit a home with a gun was in the wrong line of work.officer jonathan key flicked off his patrol car s headlights and slowed down as he neared the brick duplex on west jewell place. he planned to stop short of the home, four houses or so back, and walk the rest of the way. but before he had a chance to park, he heard a loud pop - pop - pop. then all he could see were sparks and dust.did someone just shoot fireworks at my car he wondered, his mind racing to make sense of the chaos.it was, after all, july 5, the day after independence day. perhaps some still - drunk yahoo thought it would be fun to light up a police car with a leftover roman candle.shaking off his initial confusion, key fell back on his training. . . that s when he noticed the blood. it arced from his left arm at the elbow, strong and steady, a thick red parabola. this was supposed to be a routine call, a welfare check on some middle - age guy upset about his failing marriage. what the hell was happening key had been dispatched to the home 20 minutes earlier by the lakewood police department, after a woman called 911 to express concern about her husband. the couple had been fighting all day, and the husband, after concluding the relationship was damaged beyond repair, said he no longer wanted to live. but there was something key didn t know.the husband had later made a 911 call of his own, saying there was a guy outside his home with a gun, ready to kill a bunch of people. when the dispatcher asked the husband where he was located in relation to the armed man, his response was curt i m the guy with the gun. realizing he d been shot, key abandoned his car and retreated west, a trail of blood marking his path. . heading for a row of cars for shelter, he grabbed the mic attached to his uniform to radio for help.shots fired. i ve been hit.his driverless vehicle coasted east, bouncing off a green subaru outback before colliding with a red ford pickup. from the bed of that truck, moments before, the distraught husband had fired three rounds from a semi - automatic rifle into key s car.key didn t know if he was bleeding from an artery or a vein, but he knew he was losing a lot of blood, and quickly. his uniform had already soaked through. he also knew it didn t take long, minutes in some cases, for severe bleeding to turn into fatal bleeding.from his bulletproof vest, key detached a tourniquet. not many officers carried one, but a few guys in his department had previously been in the military, where tourniquets are standard issue. they had recently shown him how the device worked and piqued his interest. shortly after, he completed a day - long course and learned how to use the modern tourniquet, which was designed for soldiers in combat to apply with one hand. key thought. all across lakewood, wailing police vehicles screeched toward west jewell place, where the man, now holding a .44 magnum, would soon be subdued, though not before wounding another officer. meanwhile, 32 - year - old jonathan key, who had no plans of leaving his young son fatherless, no intention of making his pregnant wife a widow, placed the tourniquet around his left biceps, above the wound, and turned the small attached rod to draw it tight.the bleeding stopped.everybody bleeds. we bleed from inflamed gums, irritated noses and skinned knees. we bleed from nicks, from scrapes, from piercings. we bleed when paring knives slip, when surly cats scratch, when wayward baseballs miss gloves and find teeth.most times, the bleeding is minor, stopping on its own or with the aid of nothing more than a bit of cloth and a touch of pressure. of more concern are the other times, less frequent but frequent enough, when the bleeding is anything but trivial. the bleeding may be internal a blood vessel tears after a fall from a ladder; a spleen ruptures in a car crash. it may be external a faulty machine severs a factory worker s leg; a desperate man shoots a police officer in the arm.wherever it is and whatever the because, severe bleeding can turn a dire situation deadly in a hurry if not brought under control. you might think that we had by now learned pretty much all there is to know about how best to curb blood loss, considering that we ve been bleeding for millennia, and rarely by choice. alas, there is still much to learn. uncontrolled hemorrhage remains a major because of preventable death following injury.but why is that why aren t we better at preventing blood loss at the scenes of accidents, shootings, explosions and car crashes well, let s just say that trauma care, unlike many areas of medicine, isn t exactly a hotbed of innovation. in fact, it may not have advanced at all over the past decade if not for two things the war in afghanistan and the war in iraq. wars always advance trauma care, and those advances come back to the civilian world and help civilians, says dr. john holcomb, former head of the you.s. army s institute of surgical research, who served 23 years as a military trauma surgeon. in between wars, what should happen is that we enhance trauma care in the civilian sector, so that when a war starts, and it will again, because human nature hasn t changed, we can start the war with the highest - quality trauma care possible for soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. if the past is any indication, however, peacetime innovation is unlikely. throughout history, new ideas on how to keep victims of major trauma alive have almost exclusively come from wars. he who would become a surgeon should join the army and follow it, the greek physician hippocrates wrote thousands of years ago. the same could be said today. the currency of change in trauma medicine remains the blood of soldiers.in the civilian world, injuries are the leading because of death for people under age 45, accounting for more than 10,000 annual deaths in canada and nearly 190,000 in the you.s. because it is a disease of young people, trauma is far and away the leading because of life years lost.the rise in recent years of mass - casualty events, such as the 2013 bombings at the boston marathon, has prompted some interest in improving emergency medicine. it is becoming increasingly common, for example, for paramedics, firefighters and police officers in the you.s. to carry military - grade tourniquets. and as the recent attack on parliament hill showed, even canada isn t immune to an active - shooter emergency. still, funding for trauma research in north america pales in comparison to money invested in studies for cancer, hiv aids and many other diseases.the paucity of trauma research outside war also means soldiers are far more likely to die from survivable wounds at the beginning of a lengthy conflict, before medical personnel have opportunity to adapt to particular wound patterns, such as the havoc wreaked on limbs by improvised explosive devices. in the vietnam war, bleeding from extremities was the number one because of preventable death, accounting for between seven and eight per cent of all fatalities. thirty years later, during the early stages of the wars in afghanistan and iraq, the percentage of soldiers dying from wounds to legs and arms was virtually the same.eventually, however, that figure dropped by two - thirds, to less than three per cent, thanks in part to innovative products to control hemorrhaging on the ground, such as bandages that promote blood clotting, which allowed soldiers to survive long enough to reach operating tables in combat surgical hospitals. but the change responsible for saving the most lives, hundreds or even thousands by some estimates, was not the introduction of a brand new device but rather the modification of an ancient one that, for reasons based more on myth than fact, had long ago fallen out of favour. the tourniquet would be number one, says colonel homer tien, a toronto surgeon who leads trauma research for the canadian forces. by far. the clatter of the chinook helicopter, both blades spinning, added to the racket from the other eight or nine aircraft preparing for takeoff to create a thunderous roar. the noise was nearly deafening, spc. andrew harriman noticed as he walked up the ramp at the rear of the helicopter.it was not only loud on the ramp but dark as well, the red lights inside the door above doing little to guide harriman and the soldier to his right, who was also boarding the chinook. nearing the entrance, the other soldier became entangled in a long wire that, somehow, had wrapped itself around the trigger of the machine gun mounted at the top of the ramp. harriman had one foot in the helicopter when four .30 calibre rounds burst toward his left leg.the bullets ripped through harriman s calf, six inches below the knee, breaking the fibula, destroying the tibia, pulverizing muscle and tissue and nerves. harriman felt the leg snap. he fell off the ramp, landing in the blackness beneath the chinook. his screams for help went unanswered, his voice no match for the din of the giant machines all around him. the soldiers close enough to have heard the shots had their backs turned to him, thinking they were under attack and taking positions to return fire.unable to see, harriman reached for the injury to assess the damage. blood gushed through his fingers.even if he was soon found, it would take 20 minutes, minimum, to fly to the emergency room at camp warhorse in baqubah, more than enough time to bleed out. of all the 300 or so soldiers here in the village of quba, it was harriman, only 23 but already a senior combat medic, who knew the dangers of uncontrolled blood loss.he had seen his share of carnage since arriving in iraq seven months earlier, none worse than on a mid - january morning in the south of diyala province. a flatbed truck travelling with his unit, carrying about 30 iraqi soldiers, had gone up in smoke and fire after tripping an anti - tank mine. harriman was the first medic on the scene, and he was greeted with utter chaos dead bodies, severed limbs, desert sand wet with blood. he scrambled from soldier to soldier, using all 11 of his tourniquets to give each man a fighting chance of survival. his actions saved many lives that day, including the life of a man who lost two legs and an arm in the blast.now it was time to save his own life. harriman pulled a tourniquet from a pocket, though he wasn t sure where to place it. it was supposed to go two or three inches above the wound, but he couldn t see a thing, including the exact location of the injury. he knew it was on the lower leg, but how low putting the tourniquet on the knee wasn t an option; the pressure would crush the joint.harriman had no way of knowing how this situation would play out. he didn t know soldiers would find him seconds later. he didn t know he would soon be bouncing from camp warhorse to germany and then back home to the you.s. he didn t know he would undergo eight surgeries over the next four weeks, or that he would eventually walk again without trouble, though his running days were over.at that moment, lying in the dark with a hole in his leg, his only concern was the problem at hand. . to be safe, he placed the tourniquet fairly high, midway up the thigh. it usually took three turns of the rod to create enough pressure to halt blood flow, but he couldn t see if that did the job. so, despite the excruciating pain of further compressing the tissue beneath the already tight black strap, harriman twisted the rod twice more.the bleeding stopped.it did more harm than good. it damaged soft tissue, destroyed nerves. it starved limbs of blood and oxygen and led to amputations. it was, the suggested in 1916, an invention of the devil.throughout its history, which dates back to the roman empire, the tourniquet has had its share of detractors. in the second world war, many medics believed the device was the primary reason wounded soldiers were losing limbs. that stigma persisted, and tourniquets were used sparingly during the vietnam war.the problem, however, was not with the concept but rather with the application. for years, tourniquets were considered an absolute last resort, says dr. peter pons, an emergency physician in denver and the associate medical director for the national association of emergency medical technicians. what we learned from the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that a proper tourniquet can be used safely and effectively. in 2005, the you.s. army institute of surgical research tested seven tourniquets. it eventually settled on the combat application tourniquet, or c - a - t, a lightweight device with a wide, self - adhering band that uses a one - handed windlass system to apply consistent pressure around the circumference of a limb. every deployed soldier now carries one.a 2011 military study of 862 tourniquets applied on 651 limbs found that a superior product combined with quick transport to combat hospitals saved lives with minimal risk. the survival rate was 87 per cent. no amputations resulted solely from the use of tourniquets.the wars in iraq and afghanistan have also resulted in the creation of numerous other products and practices to control blood loss. since 2008, the first aid kit of every you.s. soldier has contained hemostatic gauze impregnated with kaolin, a clay that prompts the body s blood coagulation response. more recent innovations include a pocket - sized injector filled with tiny sponges that expand when inserted into a wound, an abdominal - aortic tourniquet for pelvic wounds and a junctional tourniquet for injuries too high on a limb for the c - a - t.another change credited with saving the lives of many soldiers is the evolution of blood transfusion in iraq and afghanistan. in the beginning of the wars, soldiers with massive blood loss were given saline, then red blood cells, then maybe plasma but rarely platelets, the cells that allow blood to clot. the results were dismal. by 2010, when almost all transfusions were performed with equal parts plasma, platelets and red blood cells, those outcomes had vastly improved. every major trauma centre in the united states does this now, and most in canada and even in europe, says lt. col. andrew cap, chief of blood research for the you.s. army institute of surgical research. we understand the importance of maintaining the clotting function and not getting behind on that, and that concept has totally permeated trauma care around the world. yet another example of how civilian lives have been saved by blood spilled in war. with the war in iraq over and the conflict in afghanistan nearing its end, some military physicians wonder if the civilian world will return the favour by continuing to invest in trauma research. or will innovation once again stagnate until the next bloody conflict it took several years of bloodshed in iraq and afghanistan to learn that a tourniquet 30 worth of nylon, plastic and velcro could be the difference between life and death on the battlefield. for many young soldiers, that was a lesson learned far too late.the day was coming to an end, and the soldiers were looking forward to the comforts back at the air base when they received new orders. insurgents had just fired rockets at the city of kirkuk. .minutes later, the 14 soldiers were sitting in three humvees driving down a dark back road when the insurgents found them. the convoy was pummelled with rocket -

side opening. he could hear other soldiers in the vehicle returning fire. swerving to avoid a grenade, sams missed a turn in the road and was thrown from the vehicle as it plowed into a field.his body armour caught on the humvee, which dragged him 20 metres before coming to a stop. sams tried to move but couldn t. his arm was stuck under a wheel of the 1,100 - kilogram vehicle.the gunfire had stopped, and in the quiet sams shouted for help.out of the dark stumbled 1 lt. david bernstein, a popular soldier whose love of physical fitness had earned him the nickname super dave. bernstein attempted to climb into the humvee but fell back onto the ground. he tried again; he fell again. finally, on his fifth attempt, bernstein managed to get behind the wheel and back up the vehicle, freeing sams, before tumbling out and into the dirt once more.sams went to bernstein and discovered the lieutenant had been shot in the left leg, above the knee. he tied a field dressing around the wound, and left briefly to check on the other two soldiers in the back of the humvee. one was dead, shot in the neck, but the other was unharmed. sams told him to stand guard in case the insurgents attacked again.he returned to bernstein, kneeling down to take a better look at the wound. his pants were instantly drenched in blood. sams realized the lieutenant wouldn t last long if he didn t stop the bleeding. he looked for a stick to use in a make - shift tourniquet but couldn t find one. so he grabbed the nozzle from a can of fuel and used that to twist a field dressing tight around the leg. it didn t work.sams cut the strap off a rifle and twisted it around bernstein s leg, but it was too short and kept coming undone. his options exhausted, sams tied a field dressing over the rifle strap to secure it. without access to a proper tourniquet, it was the best he could do.soldiers from the other humvees had by then returned and spotted them. as they approached, sams checked bernstein for a pulse. there wasn t one. the 24 - year - old lieutenant high school valedictorian, fifth in his class at west point, future recipient of a silver star for bravery in action had lost too much blood.his heart had stopped."
2015-01-02,"Harper, the message and Canadian democracy","it s part corporate news management and part resentment among conservatives of the old reform party of what they see as an elite press.it s not doing face - to - face interviews and not being open with information, over - managing the flow of information from government to the people and clamping down on the number of people who have access to the media. everything is massaged and planned and manipulated. in many cases, people who want to know what government s doing media, mps, ngos, scientists, ordinary citizens never really find out.they thought it was unfair and patronizing in a lot of cases.sometimes, but they didn t understand how government worked. they brought a lot of prejudices to ottawa and tried to make them fit. they saw the public service as an enemy and the christian fundamentalists among them saw science as a left - wing enemy wanting to shut down the oil industry with bogus climate change science. they were going to open up government and restore democracy but harper s accountability act turned into a bad joke.it became easier for them. it was a lot simpler to shut down information coming from caucus and ministers and government experts. they also wanted to change the story of canada from what they saw as a central canadian narrative to a more western, more militarist, less peacekeeping a more heroic version of canadian history and re - make the way canadians think about their own country. and they have done a fairly good job.they replace an old liberal establishment with a new conservative establishment. they want to replace the old liberal myths and replace them with conservative myths. so the liberal myth of pierre trudeau, the constitution and charter of rights is replaced by vimy ridge and canada punching above its weight, with the conservatives as the political arm. it would be a tory government of a new tory canada. it could keep them in power for a long time if they pull it off.not unless canadians make it clear that it is part of their mandate. how much of their government do canadians want done in secret how weak do they want parliament to be it s about our democracy. the house of commons barely functions now and it s the only national democratic institution we have. the system now works as an elected dictatorship, and i m not sure how easy it will be to change that back. what s needed is for politicians to trust people to decide things for themselves instead of manipulating them.any message control that limits the ability of individual mps to function the unprecedented amount of party control over mps, the weakening of commons committees and the deliberate derailing of committee work. and the hammering away at the parliamentary budget officer and efforts to de - legitimize the auditor general. when the prime minister s office is deciding which choices to make, there isn t any democracy any more.when they clue in but people are so disconnected from government. sometimes i think the veneer of democracy in this country is very thin because we are all used to being ruled by one elite or the other.we ve had a free ride in the sweep of history. we ve slowly developed what we needed to get by. when you have 30 million people living on top of one of the greatest resource areas of the world, it doesn t take many brains to get rich off it.there is starting to be a bit of a backlash over the way the government has cracked down on information. people don t see it as some big thing but rather as single issues treatment of veterans, shutting down environmental scientists. but the whole country isn t up in arms, and i think stephen harper has a good chance of winning the election, at least with a minority. he is a very effective campaigner. i write about their propaganda machine with some respect because it has always served them very well during election campaigns.kill the messengers is published by harpercollins"

2015-01-02,Family court lawyer urges colleagues to speak out against new courthouse security,"new security legislation affecting access to ontario courthouses is an overreaction by the provincial government and vulnerable to a constitutional challenge, a leading ottawa family court lawyer said friday.pam maceachern, part of a family law community that handles more than half of ottawa court business, is urging more lawyers to speak out about changes to the police services act. my hope is that enough people would speak out against limiting public access to the judicial process and raise issues about how this is a step in the wrong direction, maceachern told the citizen.the defence counsel association of ottawa has described the new measures as draconian. the ottawa courthouse has had three open access entrances since it opened in 1986 but when a 1 - million - plus security re - construction project is finished next spring, members of the public will have to line up at the elgin street entrance to be security - screened and pass through metal detectors.what irks lawyers most are new measures already in place where police and security guards are asking members of the public to state their business at the courthouse and respond to any other related questions.ottawa court officials planned to introduce the enhanced security as a package with the metal detectors and searches but fast tracked the question and answer screening portion after october s shooting at the nearby national war memorial.police and security staff can also search people if they choose to do so and, in extreme cases, arrest them. i m not thrilled about metal detectors, said maceachern, but they are installed in many other courthouses. we just escaped it in ottawa for a while. but questioning and possibly searching people is an overreaction, she said. in the name of security we are attacking a fundamental underpinning of our democratic process, she said. there is no basis for doing it. more people get shot in fast food outlets than in courthouses. while many of the complaints about the new security measures are common to all lawyers, people arriving to resolve family issues such as custody and financial support are especially vulnerable and likely to be intimidated at the courthouse door, added maceachern. you ve got people from marginalized groups who have an urgent need for the justice system to assist them, she said. to put up barriers to those people is concerning. defence counsel association president trevor brown, who has vowed to challenge the new measures at a stakeholder meeting at the courthouse later this month, has called them fundamentally flawed. while there is always a need to make sure the courts are secure, he said, these are draconian measures, and are susceptible to arbitrary use and abuse. one should not be required to submit to an interrogation and a search as the price to be paid for accessing what are supposed to be public courts, he added. the courts are where we go for protection and enforcement of our most fundamental rights and freedoms. it s not supposed to be the place we go to have them abused. the traditional system of placing portable metal detectors outside courtrooms where high - profile cases are being heard has worked well, said brown.minister of community safety and correctional services and ottawa - centre mpp yasir naqvi says that police in each jurisdiction are best - placed to decide on security levels at courthouses.twitter.com chrisicobb"

collecting neighbour harold gorring in hopes of impressing carol s father colonel melkett and a wealthy art collector georg bamberger coming to view brindsley s work.chaos and confusion ensue when the power fails harold arrives home early brindsley s ex - flame clea unexpectedly arrives and the electrician is mistaken for the highly anticipated bamberger. first performed in 1965 by the national theatre, a key element to this play is its inverted lighting. the production starts darkness and the stage lights rise when the power fails.mike coderre - lalonde was a convincing and confident brindsley miller. coderre - lalonde successfully embodied brindsley s frazzled character in his committed stair tumbling and stumbling through the dark apartment. coderre - lalonde projected well and his exaggerated movements helped his physical comedy. nadine cheffi as carol melkett took on the challenge of a british accent. cheffi possessed a keen spatial awareness serving as a reminder that brindsley s apartment is, in fact, dark. costumes by ashley arrighi and jillian dover completed both characters.this production was led by student director ryan mockett, who used the whole stage throughout. the auditorium aisle became an entrance; a clever way to break the fourth wall. one character even bicycled down the aisle. the use of the tableau on the main floor of the set when actors spoke on the top floor successfully focused audience attention to the correct section of the stage. glasses and statues breaking on stage elevated the intensity and committed nature, as did the in - character curtain call.the directorial choice for cross - gender acting in the role of miss furnival was unexpected and worked extremely well. milad alamir ahmed, with his stage business and falsetto voice, became the source of much of the show s comedy.the large and detailed set by ryan mockett, jeff patterson, karl good, and chris bouchard was a highlight. the multiple levels to worked well to showcase the different rooms within the apartment. the doors on stage left were especially effective; actors could walk through brindsley s apartment, into the hallway and into harold s flat.ridgemont high school delivered a solid and convincing rendition of a difficult and demanding farce.critic, elmwood schooltake a stroll through mid -

door neighbour, harold gorring s, antique furniture for the evening while he is away. to the characters surprise, the fuse blows before the colonel arrives, harold comes back early, and brindsley s former sweetheart clea makes an untimely appearance, leaving brindsley truly in the dark.mike coderre - lalonde, whilst portraying the role of brindsley, served as a comic anchor for the farce. by means of using optimal stage space in carrying a clumsy and humorous morale, he was successful in fulfilling the aspect of physical comedy the role demanded. nadine cheffi, playing carole melkett, retained a clear british debutante accent for the majority of the performance, drawing the era of the sixties right to the stage. cheffi gave a prominent performance filled with comedic reaction to the apparent darkness on stage.milad alamir ahmed served as the highest point of comic relief in the role of miss furnival, an older resident of the flat who comes to seek refuge at brindsley s during the power outage. his implementation of falsetto contributed to the character s facetiousness. by way of expressing slapstick through bawdy movements and reacting to the dialogue on stage, he exaggerated the zany elements of the play to an extent that was humorous for all. tate cummings and suraj altamimi performed the supporting roles of colonel melkett and harold gorring with competence. both actors were effective in staying true to their characters distinct personalities while contributing to the comic charisma surrounding them.execution of the lighting cues exhibited strong moments in which the transitions from illuminated to dimmed sets were efficient and synchronized with character blocking. the delivery of the sound cue signalling the blown fuse was concurrent with its complementary lighting cue. as for the set, vibrant student - produced paintings coloured bridsley s flat, while a sturdy set of stairs efficiently connected the art studio and the levelled bedroom.ridgemont student ryan mockett directed the play from start to finish. his directorial decisions appropriately complemented the playwright s intentions. cross casting for the role of miss furvival and having the actors perform the curtain call while in character were two examples of his tasteful orchestration. furthermore, mockett s self - arranged character blocking displayed an understanding of the stage and insight into shaffer s play. is quite the challenge to take on, but ridgemont high school delivered a very entertaining performance.critic, elmwood schoolsanity may prevail in the light, but when the world is thrown into darkness, madness and hilarity ensue. this was entertainingly proven by the cast and crew of ridgemont high school with their appropriately chaotic rendition of peter shaffer s .first performed in 1965, follows brindsley miller mike coderre - lalonde , an aspiring sculptor desperate for a commission. in an effort to impress a superbly wealthy potential investor and the father of his debutante fianc e, he clandestinely borrows some expensive furniture from his friend s apartment. his plans are thwarted when a fuse blows, plunging his apartment into darkness and rendering it the stage for a variety of hilarious mishaps.ridgemont high school s talented cast and crew effectively highlighted the comedy in an alluring cavalcade of misconceptions, deceit and blind assumptions. actors often successfully appeared sightless, especially when expressing it through daring physical stunts. every role was played with enthusiasm, resulting in a thoroughly entertaining performance.coderre - lalonde, dressed in a suitably 60s red turtleneck, fittingly expressed the frazzled lead, supplementing his performances with an impressive display of physical comedy. in this respect he was hilariously convincing, once even tumbling down a small flight a stairs, a testament to the sturdy construction of the set as well as his skill. nadine cheffi played carol melket, brindsley s posh fianc e, neatly expressing the character s amusing quirks.jeff patterson played shupvanzigh, the electrician called to mend the blown fuse, with a relaxed confidence, hitting every comic cue while contrasting the intense excitement of the other characters. furnival, played by milad alamir ahmed, is an initially priggish woman who, terrified of the dark, seeks refuge in brinsdley s apartment. a strict teetotaller, she is mistakenly given a glass of gin and, hooked, procures much more, becoming totally inebriated. ahmed settled comfortably into a marvellously ridiculous personality complete with an unbroken falsetto. he maintained this hilarious persona every moment on stage, leaping into dialogue with impeccable comic timing. was designed to be performed with a reversed lighting scheme, so the majority of the play is in light, which dims whenever a light source is introduced on stage. the resulting lighting challenges were tackled with effectiveness. this served to illuminate an outstanding set; a beautiful, eclectic, bohemian collection of pieces that demonstrated a mature understanding of the time period. different levels allowed for interesting and dynamic blocking, which was capably orchestrated by student director ryan mockett.ridgemont high school s cast and crew obviously took great joy in their performance, and they created a well - produced, competently acted and thoroughly hilarious farce.critic, elmwood schoolwhen the power goes out there is only so much to do. or is there ridgemont high school s production of recounts the humorous activities of a group when there is a power outage in their building.peter shaffer s one -

lalonde played brindsley miller, the young sculptor harbouring many secrets. his body language brought forth elements of physical comedy throughout the farce. coderre - lalonde added to his smart - thinking, witty portrayal of brindsley miller by using varying vocal tone and facial expression. nadine cheffi performed as carol melkett, brindsley miller s debutante fianc e. cheffi s spatial awareness was evident through her movements, which created a realistic depiction of her character in a blackout.colonel melkett, performed by tate cummings, is carol melkett s strict and protective father. cummings created an accurate portrayal of a stern military man by maintaining a straight face and harshness of tone regardless of circumstance. jeff patterson played schupvanzigh, the clueless electrician hired to fix the fuse box. through his diction and comedic accent, patterson added to the humour of the play while not distracting from the dialogue and action on stage. milad alamir ahmed memorably played miss furnival, an elderly neighbour. he maintained a falsetto voice for the play, contributing to the humour already existent within the script.student ryan mockett skilfully directed ridgemont high school s production of . his blocking of the play heavily emphasized physical comedy and fittingly integrated with the dialogue. devon st. john remarkably executed the reversed lighting scheme. the set, which consisted of brindsley miller s studio apartment, was well designed and constructed. it was very detailed; including paintings and sculptures that added to the realism of the play. the set was also incredibly sturdy. through the many falls and movements, the set pieces endured the length of the play.ridgemont high school s production of was hilarious and engaging. the cast and crew entertained with accomplished blocking, a detailed set, and an exuberant performance.critic, st. joseph high schooldarkness can hide nearly everything, including stolen furniture and even a jealous ex -

2015-01-02,That's the spirit: A toast to hosers everywhere,"it is as ubiquitously canadian as plaid flannel and the catchall phrase eh, a sound as instantly recognizable as a loon s mournful call announcing the end of summer. it conjures nostalgia as powerfully as the good old days. it is emblematic of our youthful innocence, as surely a calendar of our lives as wax candles melting on a birthday cake.it is the scrape of shovels echoing off nearby houses, the steamy puffs of breath, the high - pitched calls of children shouting i m open ! i m open ! the slash of metal blades on hard ice, the clacking of sticks and the clanging of frozen rubber pucks hitting metal goalposts.and behind it all are folks known as hosers those parents and other community - minded volunteers men, mostly, in that taking - out - the - garbage kind of way who take turns shoveling and flooding outdoor city rinks on arctic mornings and nights, clearing breakaway paths for future sidney crosbys and rebecca johnstons.at mckellar park in ottawa s west end, matt firth is out on the ice on the morning of the last day of 2014, rebuilding a rink that unseasonably warm christmas weather reduced to lumpy slush.firth is the doyen of about 30 volunteers who tend the park s rink, a five - nights - a - week task that requires little beyond simply time, patience and thick socks, plus the minimum strength required to lift, move and point an industrial - size hose.it is at this rink, and thousands of others just like it, that countless youngsters learn to skate and play hockey, a pastime that will propel many through their lives. regardless of their age or ability, says firth, i think lots of people prefer to be out here. in this era of people driving their kids all over the place, to power - skating lessons and stickhandling lessons and all that other b.s., it s nice to see them keep it simple and just come out here and play hockey. it s really nice to watch when there s a 16 - on - 16 game with no goalies, no raising the puck, when they have to self - police themselves and the older ones have to figure out how to integrate the younger ones without being completely condescending. it s nice to see the kids out just playing hockey. uncharacteristically, firth is alone on this morning. usually there are a few of us doing it, he says, although the job hardly requires the extra manpower. mostly it s for company. the other three or four guys will make conversation and help pass the time. but we re also guilty of over - thinking what we re doing. you get guys who make observations about your technique and how it could be better. but if you re going to stand here with a hose like this, you might as well pontificate a lot about the best technique for making ice. that said, he admits it s hardly rocket science, but it is science wait for it to be cold enough. move the hose around. flood. wait. repeat. it s the kind of job that once prompted his oldest son, sam, to remark, this is boring. a researcher with cupe, firth has been helping build and maintain mckellar s rink since he moved to ottawa from hamilton a dozen years ago. sam was a three - year - old then the same age firth was when he began skating on hamilton s outdoor rinks and a next - door neighbour who noticed the father - and - son combo out on the rink suggested he get involved. now it s matt who prods, pokes and encourages other neighbours to do the same. it s not asking a lot, he says. you come out here for an hour or an hour - and - a - half a week. and if we don t, it doesn t get built. so what s the big deal on this cold final morning of 2014, firth is careful for the time being to avoid flooding one end of the rink, where three youngsters and their mother are engaged in a game of two - on - two shinny. eight - year - old simon west and his 10 - year - old twin sisters, bridget and margot, live in the neighbourhood and come to the rink whenever their schedules, and the weather, permit. the girls play on the same ottawa girls hockey association team, and have come to specifically work on their shots and crossovers. simon has briefly abandoned his stick to simply skate.firth nods in their direction. that s why i do this.

2015-01-02,Editorial: A new chance in the Fahmy case,"three journalists jailed in egypt, including canadian mohamed fahmy, will get a retrial. this is only a small crack in this horrible case, but it s a crack, and now the task is to wrench it open.fahmy, who also holds egyptian citizenship, was accused along with australian peter greste and egyptian baher mohammed of collaboration with the muslim brotherhood, of fabricating news to give the impression of internal strife in egypt and thereby harming the country s international reputation.in reality, all three were journalists working for al - jazeera, which happens to be funded by qatar, which has supported the muslim brotherhood. the greatest harm done to egypt s reputation comes from the state s eagerness to jail journalists and repress information just to poke a stick at a qatar. not only does the egyptian state give itself a reputation for brutality through these sham trials, but it makes itself look ridiculous in the process. a about their arrest showed images of computers against the backdrop of scary music from thor the dark world.greste is a veteran foreign correspondent who s worked for reuters and the bbc, working in bosnia, south africa, mexico and afghanistan. producer baher mohamed worked for a japanese newspaper and did freelance work for cnn. fahmy moved to canada with his family in the early 1990s and has worked for cnn and the new york times; as a private egyptian citizen, he had even joined demonstrations against the muslim brotherhood and the morsi regime. he was the recipient of the 2014 world press freedom award in canada.the trial was a complete sham from start to finish. there was no evidence that the journalists were part of a terrorist plot, because of course they weren t. the prosecutors presented a pile of blatantly, ridiculously irrelevant evidence and the men were sentenced to seven years for fahmy and greste, and 10 for mohammed.a retrial is at least an acknowledgement that the original trial was, to put it mildly, flawed. but the men remain in prison, where they have been for more than a year. canada has not forgotten about mohamed fahmy.the president of egypt can, under a new law, deport greste and fahmy during the trial, if fahmy gives up egyptian citizenship. this would at least allow fahmy to return to canada. this is a chance for president abdel fattah el - sisi to start to be the champion for the egyptian people he promised to be, to put an end to the mass detentions, show trials and other rights abuses. no country s international reputation was ever helped by jailing journalists."
2015-01-02,Iraqi generalâ€™s warnings about war against ISIL stands in contrast to Canadian militaryâ€™s view of success in Iraq,"the writes about an iraqi general s frank honesty about how well or not the war against the islamic state in iraq and the levant isil aka islamic state is going. it makes interesting reading. it also stands in contrast to the views of canadian military officers who insist the war against isil is unfolding with great success, both in the air and on the ground here is the article lt. gen. abdul - wahab al - saadi had 225 fighters, a single abrams tank, a pair of mortars, two artillery pieces and about 40 armored humvees when he set out to retake a strategic city in northern iraq captured by islamic state militants over the summer.it took 30 days as his force made an agonizingly slow journey for 40 kilometers 25 miles through roadside bombs and suicide car attacks, then successfully laid siege to the oil refinery city of beiji. the campaign earned al - saadi the biggest battlefield victory by iraqi forces since islamic state fighters swept over most of northern and western iraq in a summer blitz, prompting the collapse of the military.yet al - saadi is deeply pessimistic. in a two - hour interview with the associated press, he said iraq s military lacks weapons, equipment and battle - ready troops and complained that you.s. air support was erratic. both the military and the government remain riddled with corruption, he said. most of the senior generals serving when the military fell apart had skills more suited to world war ii, he said. if things don t get better, warned the general, the country could end up divided between its shiite, sunni and kurdish populations.the extremists are beatable when confronted with a proper force, he said. but he worries that the military s multiple woes prevent it from doing so. already, there is a danger the jihadis could retake beiji, he said.a baghdad - born shiite with family roots in southern iraq, al - saadi complained of excesses by some of the shiite volunteers who joined the fight against the sunni militants and on whom the military has come to rely. i am a military man, and they don t respect the rules by which we operate, he said. volunteers, for example, looted homes in government - controlled areas around the sunni city of tikrit and tried to intimidate army officers, he said. during his march toward beiji, some of the volunteers whom he deployed as a rear guard left their posts.the government and its media consistently praise the volunteers role in the war against the sunni militants.the you.s. - trained al - saadi, who is second - in - command of the army s elite counterterrorism forces, spoke at his office in one of saddam hussein s baghdad palaces. the chain - smoking general wore a baseball cap and green sweater the same outfit he wears on the front lines, without helmet or body armor or indications of his rank. in the beiji campaign, he was wounded by shrapnel in his arm and dangerously close to his eye, on top of wounds he suffered last summer in the western province of anbar.on his office walls hung photos of himself with former prime minister nouri al - maliki. al - saadi said he had a close relationship with al - maliki during his eight years in office. but the shiite leader, he said, bears the moral responsibility for the debacle against the islamic state group.al - maliki stepped down in august, replaced by haider al - abadi, who has sought to draw sunni support against the militants. according to al - saadi, al - abadi has largely left the military to run the war against the islamic state as it sees fit. al - abadi has also shaken up the military, pushing aside dozens of corrupt or inefficient officers. he has also stopped payments of millions of dollars in salaries disbursed to thousands of nonexistent troops, or ghost soldiers. al - saadi is the head of military operations in salahuddin province, where beiji is located, and his troops were stationed in a base outside tikrit. the islamic state group holds tikrit itself and most of the surrounding ground.a veteran of iraq s 1980 - 88 war against shiite iran, al - saadi said he turned down offers of help from iranian military advisers in retaking beiji. iran has been closely helping iraq s government in the fight against the extremists. if i had accepted help from non - iraqis, the history books will say the victory was not ours, the iraqis, he said.he had troubles from the outset with top military leaders in baghdad who wanted beiji retaken quickly. i told them i can reach beiji from tikrit in three days, but i will lose many of my men, he said. i told them i will do it my way and get beiji back. they were unhappy, but they had no choice. setting out from tikrit in mid - october, al - saadi advanced slowly, abandoning the main road he knew to be infested with roadside bombs. instead, he and his men went by foot through the desert parallel to the road.each day, they walked several kilometers, stopped and built a sand barrier on the main road to fend off suicide car bombers, while engineers would clear roadside bombs. once the road was cleared, the humvees and lone tank would proceed up to the barrier where they would wait until another stretch of the road was cleared, he said.the top brass in baghdad called him repeatedly on his cell phone to complain he was moving too slowly. i told them again and again that i need to move cautiously to protect my men, he said though he added that al - abadi called him to express support.it took three weeks to reach beiji, fighting the whole way, then another week to take the town. all in all, more than two dozen suicide car bombs were hurled at them. he said logistical bottlenecks in the military left him with only one earth - mover to construct sand barriers, which broke down often or had its tires shot out by snipers.he blames one of its breakdowns for the death of police lt. gen. faisal malik al - zamel during the fight in beiji. with no sand barrier, a suicide attacker in an explosives - packed truck its tires and windshield protected by plates of armor struck while al - zamel stood in the open speaking on his telephone on november 7. his men shouted for him to get back inside his armored vehicle but he didn t act fast enough, said al - saadi, who was at the scene.al - saadi was also left skeptical that the americans are serious in helping iraq defeat the extremists with the coalition air campaign. sometimes, they would carry out airstrikes that i never asked for, and at other times i begged them for a single airstrike and they never did it, citing logistical issues or orders from higher up, he said. i don t think they trust iraq s government or military. also, al - saadi s only means of communication with baghdad was a mobile phone and whenever it had no signal he could not call in airstrikes.in the end, his strategy paid off. beiji was recaptured in mid - november, and the entire campaign cost 12 lives and about 30 injured among his troops. on the other side, he estimates his forces killed around 1,500 islamic state fighters.brig - gen. ayad al - leheibi, of the police s rapid deployment force, echoed that estimate and confirmed most of the details in al - saadi s account. al - leheibi and about 120 of his men fought alongside al - saadi in the beiji campaign.now al - saadi worries the victory is in danger of being reversed. already islamic state militants are back on the outskirts of beiji, and he said the men left to hold the city are too few.one unit of reinforcements was attacked on the way to beiji and quickly retreated, he said. a second one, 50 - man strong, made it to the city but came under night attack by militants. there was so much confusion and panic, they started shooting at each other in the dark, he said. we lost 10 men, nearly as many as we lost in the entire campaign.

2015-01-02,Peter McKenna: Canada's influence in Cuba could wane,"it s not surprising that canadians were at the centre of trying to foster some sort of rapprochement between washington and havana. in fact, we ve been trying to play the role of intermediary between the you.s. and cuban governments for over 50 years.let s remember that canada has been viewed as a useful interlocutor because of our amicable relations with both cuba and the united states. in short, we ve had the crucial ingredient of trust in the eyes of the two governments.according to some you.s. officials, canada s involvement in the most recent secret talks was nothing short of indispensable. we were undoubtedly the bridge that was needed to bring the two sides together.as we look ahead, though, what will a you.s. - cuba reconciliation mean for the future of canada - cuba relations will it weaken or strengthen the historical linkages between the two countries will we be able to use our uninterrupted relations with cuba to gain special dispensation or favours from havana going forward for the cubans, canada was one of only two countries in the americas the other being mexico not to sever diplomatic relations with revolutionary cuba in 1962. since 1959, canada has embraced a cuba policy of dialogue, commercial exchange and principled engagement which was highlighted by prime minister pierre trudeau s 1976 visit to the country and jean chr tien s difficult meetings in havana with fidel castro in april of 1998.though relations between canada and cuba have not always been smooth or cordial witness ottawa s refusal to invite cuba to the quebec city summit of the americas in 2001 , neither side has deemed it necessary to shut down the channels of diplomatic communication. and the cubans understand full well that the canadians who have been long - standing critics of the you.s. embargo against cuba since the early 1960s were not going to stab them in the back.canada, unlike the you.s., has been careful over the decades not to allow human rights considerations to impede bilateral relations with the cubans. official ottawa has known for some time that hostility toward, and isolation of, cuba has exhibited few tangible results.for our american friends, we had street cred because canadian officials in cuba have been sharing with them intelligence on the country for over 50 years. they also knew that the canadians have wanted the same things in cuba as them since 1959 political liberalization, respect for basic human rights and an open economy while differing sharply on the means of securing those policy objectives.it s worth mentioning, though, that the normalization of you.s. - cuban relations could have both positive and negative implications for canada. we may very well benefit from seeing greater demand in cuba for additional infrastructure projects trading on our good name as long - time friends , investment opportunities in certain specialized sectors like oil and mineral development along with financial and banking services and from sharing canadian expertise on tourism management.but these recent developments could negatively impact canada in terms of its own commercial relationship with cuba which exceeds 1 billion annually in two - way trade . while canadian companies are highly regarded on the island, they could easily get squeezed out by their american competitors. as a result, we could eventually see a sharp decline in trade and investment dollars between canada and cuba.in addition, a good part of canada s influence in cuba is tied to havana s completely dysfunctional relationship with washington. but as you.s. - cuban relations take on greater importance, canada s leverage is likely to wane.still, this role of facilitator is precisely the kind of niche diplomacy that canada should be conducting around the world and thus prime minister stephen harper and foreign minister john baird deserve a pat on the back. but we need to be vigilant here about making sure that both havana and washington don t allow the enemies of normalization, and there are many, to undermine our outstanding efforts to date."
2015-01-02,"Afghan army opens fire on wedding party killing 28, mostly women and children","two afghan soldiers have been arrested in connection with the deaths of at least 28 people, mostly women and children, who were killed by artillery fired from military checkpoints at a wedding party, the writes.here is the rest of the article gen. sultan mahmoud, the head of the army in southern helmand province, where the incident took place on wednesday night, said the soldiers were arrested late on friday. another eight soldiers were still under investigation, he told the associated press. there is still a possibility of more arrests because the investigation is not over yet but those who were directly involved have been arrested today, he said.investigators sent from kabul by the defense ministry arrived in helmand s capital of lashkar gah earlier in the day, gen. dawlat waziri, deputy defense ministry spokesman said.an initial probe found soldiers had fired at a house from two directions while the wedding party was in full swing in the volatile district of sangin, in the poppy - producing helmand river valley.officials in the province earlier said that the artillery fire wounded at least 51 people at the house in the sarwankhala area of sangin, where government forces and taliban insurgents have fought skirmishes for the last six months since you.s. forces withdrew.mahmoud said all soldiers in the area at the time of the incident had been confined to their base until the investigation concludes.about 300 people travelled from sangin to the provincial capital of helmand, 85 kilometers 52 miles away to protest outside the home of the governor and demand justice for the dead.the incident happened just hours before afghanistan s own forces took control thursday of nationwide security after the end of the 13 - year international combat mission led by the united states and nato.fighting continues across the country, however, as taliban insurgents test the capacity of the afghan forces, trained mainly by the you.s. military but now operating largely without their help.earlier friday in lashkar gah three employees of the private azizi bank and a policeman where killed when a roadside bomb exploded beneath a bank vehicle, said omar zwak, the spokesman for the provincial governor."
2015-01-02,Winter is for seeing the birds,"happy new year to all readers. despite winter officially arriving on december 21, you have probably noticed over the past month, a slow but steady decrease in the movement and variety of birds in eastern ontario.with a few exceptions such as the snowy owl and possibly a few finches that will continue to move through our region we are officially into the winter birding season. but winter does not mean that you should put away your binoculars. on the contrary, winter birding can be one of the best times for beginners to slowly get introduced to familiar and easy to identify local species. in fact, more than 50 species sometimes over winter in the ottawa - gatineau district depending on weather conditions and temperature. for birders who wish to venture further out, an additional 20 - 30 species can usually be found in prime birding locations including kingston, presqu ile and algonquin provincial parks and prince edward county.feeder watchers, keep the feeders filled. many of our local resident species including black - capped chickadee, white - breasted nuthatch, red - breasted nuthatch and blue jay are attracted to sunflower seed and the northern cardinals enjoy both sunflower and safflower seeds. if you re putting out finch feed or nyjer seed watch for american goldfinch, house finch, pine siskin and purple finch. depending on the amount of natural food available further north there can sometimes be a variety of finches in search of food. every winter is different.suet is a great way to attract birds. you can purchase suet cakes that have a mixture of seeds in the suet or cut the fat from your roasts or steaks and freeze. downy woodpecker and hairy woodpecker enjoy suet and even the large pileated woodpecker will sometimes visit suet feeders.watch for white - breasted nuthatch, red - breasted nuthatch, and black - capped chickadee. elizabeth le geyt swears by her suet mixture of 1 cup melted suet, lard or dripping from roasts, 1 cup of chunky peanut butter, 3 cups of instant oats and 3 cups cornmeal. heat the fat and peanut butter until melted and hot. add the oats and stir and then the cornmeal. you can add raisins, berries, chopped peanuts, wild bird seed or nuts to the mix. this mix can be put into a log that has had holes drilled in it. the holes should be widely spaced and staggered so that the birds do not rub their feathers on the mix. it can be put into an empty half coconut she will or stuffed into a very large cone and hung in a tree or bush. the hairy woodpecker, and downy woodpecker along with black - capped chickadee, white - breasted nuthatch and red - breasted nuthatch will enjoy this mixture.as always, a natural consequence to an active bird feeder is visiting birds of prey. whenever there is a regular concentration of birds at one urban feeder, there is also a likely possibility of cooper s hawk, merlin or sharp - shinned hawk eyeing your feeders. at rural feeders, birds of prey may include northern goshawk, northern shrike and barred owl.the 34 annual dunrobin - breckenridge cbc will take place january 3. this count encompasses a 12 - km radius, with the centre at the dunrobin and thomas dolan parkway. if you live within this region, please email me your bird feeder observation and numbers. please include your street address.i d like to thank everyone that sent reports and or photographs during the past week. please email bird observations and or photographs to my email subject line ottawa citizen birds . for photos please provide date, location, and photographer s name, and for bird reports, observer, date and location. the birding code of ethics and guidelines of the ottawa field - naturalists club can be found at . to reach the wild bird care centre for orphaned and injured birds call 613 - 828 - 2849. access to shirley s bay is restricted. you must obtain permission from the range control office before entering the area. please call 613 - 991 - 5740 for permission. view more great photos online at"
2015-01-02,Morse: Assessing Canada's mission in Iraq,"shortly before christmas, it became clear that canada will extend its air mission over iraq beyond the original six - month commitment. that suggests that the government is both satisfied with the way things have gone so far and prepared to continue backing you.s. strategy with force.there is some debate within the canadian defence community as to whether the commitment is worth it; the conclusion tends to depend on how you define worth it cost - benefit analysis has never worked in warfare; too many variables . one argument holds that canada should bail out in the absence of a clear you.s. strategy in the region.that begs for a discussion of what strategy is, and how you can tell whether you have a clear one. it s muddied by the fact that carl von clausewitz began defining modern theories of strategy in a closed, limited - warfare system of european states, and his efforts seriously pre - dated the democratic dictum that war is too important to be left to the generals. in fact, strategy and grand strategy are less precise concepts than war colleges teach, mainly because, in the end, they are subject to the vagaries of political dynamics, and also because in a major modern state they can operate in a number of simultaneous theatres, at varying levels of coherence.we have to distinguish strategy from political rhetoric. rhetoric can shape strategy, but if it defines it, you have a problem. there is a perpetual muddle between rhetoric, grand strategy and war aims . to simplify considerably, in world war ii after america s entry in 1941 , allied war aims were unconditional surrender . grand strategy was first germany, then japan . strategy was africa, then italy, then western europe . stalin s objectives at all levels were very different. obama s original declaration, that the aim of reopening the air war over iraq and syria was to degrade and destroy isil, is rhetoric, pure and simple. it s doubtful that most people involved in the execution of the war think that destruction of isil is possible in any meaningful sense those calling for substantial ground force commitments may disagree with that .hannibal rome, 218 bc , and bush iraq, 2003 ad both possessed clear war aims at the outset. regime change summarizes both well enough; hannibal seems not to have cared what might replace rome, but his failed strategy was to break off and enlist non - roman italians. if the bush white house had a clear strategy in iraq beyond getting rid of saddam hussein, it was lost on gen. david petraeus tell me how this ends and eventually succumbed to reality on the ground. so did hannibal s. strategies are mutable and it s not mission creep if it is done with forethought and a measure of discipline. britain s war against napoleon had both; vietnam and iraq had neither.there is a big difference between clear and satisfying. degrading isil through air power is both clear and apparently effective; its offensive momentum has been disrupted and it may be showing signs of internal strain. what happens next is not that clear and probably not that satisfying, because the west cannot be the prime mover in the region. it s not going to be a clean outcome again, too many variables.but as a junior ally, canada s strategic bar is not so high. it s do we participate or not that depends less on what s going on in the middle east and more on how washington and ottawa view the involvement in bilateral terms. for what it s worth, giving air support to the kurdish peshmerga is probably more useful to a western alliance than moving the squadron into europe to help watch putin."

2015-01-02,MPs fight off major illnesses to fight on in 2015 election," , mp.liberal whip judy foote was about to deliver a speech to more than 200 people at the party s convention in montreal when she learned something was wrong.senior conservative cabinet minister lisa raitt was preparing to head to the airport for a flight to newfoundland and labrador for ministerial duties.new democrat mp h l ne leblanc was in her constituency office in montreal when she first realized something just wasn t right.toronto - area tory mp peter kent was shaving when he noticed something abnormal.for ottawa - orleans conservative mp royal galipeau, it was when he tried to stifle a sneeze.these five members of parliament come from parties across the political spectrum and represent ridings from across canada.but they share a unique bond they fought through serious health challenges in 2014 and are fighting on to run again in the 2015 federal election.illness may have taken a toll on their bodies but politics, perseverance and public service is in their blood.here are their stories judy foote was waiting for the call.the newfoundland and labrador liberal mp was at her party s annual convention in montreal in february 2014 and was about to speak to hundreds of members attending a panel discussion on liberal leadership in the commons.the 62 - year - old had fought off breast cancer 14 years earlier as a provincial politician in newfoundland, and was waiting to hear the results of a recent biopsy, after she discovered a lump on her breast.her cellphone rang. it was her doctor calling. she turned her back to the people in the room before she took the call. he said, it s positive, you have cancer again, foote recalls, during an interview in her parliament hill office.foote and her husband were also celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary that weekend. she went back to her hotel room after the panel discussion and told her husband the news. he was shocked, as we all were, says foote, first elected federally in 2008. having been through it 14 years prior to, no one wants to get cancer a second time but we all know that it can happen to anyone, and we just knew we had to deal with it again. that persistence, passion for politics and, no doubt, a bit of strong - willed stubbornness, is helping motivate foote to run again for the liberals in the next federal election, scheduled for october 19, 2015.there have been family members on her maternal side who ve had breast cancer and other forms of the disease in the past.her mother died when foote was three years old. only 38 at the time, she bled to death after having her teeth removed while in a rural hospital, although it wasn t necessarily linked to cancer.foote recently discovered that she carries the brca2 gene that makes a person far more likely to get breast cancer. it s likely she inherited the gene from her mother, but she says it s impossible to know for sure.she had a double mastectomy this year and underwent four bouts of chemotherapy, but chose not to have radiation.foote says she s now in good health and ready for another run in the next election. a lot of my inner strength comes from my faith, she says. it s all about god and you have to believe. battling through major illness a second time has also helped her develop stronger friendships with mps from both sides of the house of commons. others mps have reached out to me to speak to their loved ones or have a conversation with them personally, and i ve done that, she says. those who have been impacted by cancer, yeah, we have something in common. transport minister lisa raitt delayed a ministerial trip to newfoundland and labrador on sept. 11 so she could swing by her doctor s office to get some test results before heading to the airport.raitt, 46, had been tracking some debilitating symptoms for quite some time, although she does not want to go into detail. she repeatedly raised it during her annual physical over the past couple of years and finally scheduled an ultrasound, but there was a mix - up and it was cancelled.she didn t go again for another year and a half a decision she now regrets.when she finally had it done, it showed a growth on her ovary. she had it checked again six months later, hoping it was a cyst that had gone away. it hadn t.another six months went by before raitt had another ultrasound in august 2014 when doctors noticed the growth was getting larger. an mri followed a few weeks after that, which led the minister to the doctor s office on sept. 11, just days before the house of commons resumed sitting for the fall.her doctor told her she had a tumor on her ovary, but it was uncertain whether it was cancerous. she then hopped on the plane to newfoundland with her partner bruce. that s when it was sinking in that there was definitely something there i was not in great shape on the plane ride down, she says.raitt has cancer in her family. she worried whether the growth was ovarian cancer. politics, for the moment, was pushed to the back of her mind. she thought about her spouse of six years and two young sons, 10 and 13.raitt booked surgery within days and tried to stack as many meetings as possible in a short time to clear the decks for some time to recover.during that time, though, raitt says she didn t contemplate not running in the next federal election. her time as an mp helps set examples for her kids of the value of public service, hard work and leadership, she says. i m not quitting and i don t think it s selfish of me to enjoy my work because i really do, she says.raitt recently received good news from the test results of her november 4 surgery there was no sign of malignancy. she will be back in the house of commons when it resumes sitting in late january.but the health scare has brought some new perspective on politics and life. that s the big lesson for me. i didn t realize how thinly i stretched myself before i ended up having surgery and had to physically make myself rest, she says. i think what i m better at now is determining what is important right now and what isn t important right now. just as important, she learned a lot about her fellow parliamentarians and the compassion they can show for people who are, at times, their bitter enemy in the commons. what i learned is how you are affected by people sending you a tweet, or a note, or a card, or flowers, or whatever. it doesn t matter. the tiniest gesture of humanity it really does affect you in a positive way, she says.conservative mp peter kent was shaving around a year ago when he noticed something different about his throat.the profile of his neck on the left side was a little different than the right. there was a lump.the toronto - area mp and former environment minister was in the middle of a four - week stretch before the house of commons broke for the holidays, and waited a few weeks to contact his doctor in his thornhill riding.kent and his doctors initially thought they were dealing with a benign cyst. but following a biopsy, they discovered it was stage 4 tongue and throat cancer caused by the human papillomavirus hpv . the first thoughts are ahh ! mortality, face to face, kent remembers. but the several doctors who were looking after me were reassuring that we had caught it early enough and that the odds were relatively good. following a final diagnosis, kent had surgery and started chemotherapy and radiation in april and may. he had three major chemotherapy treatments and 33 radiation sessions, spending the summer of 2014 recovering.kent acknowledges there were many dark days of treatment on the long road back to health.it was during that time that he contemplated whether he wanted to run in 2015. the answer yes, because, as he explains it, he still had some unfinished business in politics. you review everything, says the 71 - year - old. it gives an awful lot of relevance to being alive. he now shows no sign of cancer, but will continue to have follow - up exams in the coming years.the health problems focused him on living every day to the fullest and the importance of family, says kent, crediting his wife of 33 years and daughter for helping him get through it. but i think it also focused that there are still some fulfilling moments to be had in politics and have some of the policies important to me addressed by the federal parliament. some of that unfinished business is trying to get his conservative government to fund hpv vaccinations for boys. the federal government made vaccinations available for girls in 2007 to help protect from cervical cancer and other health problems.but hpv is also a threat to men and can because cancers of the mouth throat, anus and penis.health minister rona ambrose is very supportive of providing federal funding to expand it to boys, he says, and she has been in touch with the provinces, which are responsible for vaccinations. kent hopes there will be funding for it in the 2015 federal budget.kent says he, too, received enormous support from his own caucus and across the aisle. he says he was very touched on his first day back in parliament in the fall when he got a standing ovation from fellow mps. every party has a number of mps that are fighting larger and smaller health challenges, and i think on that level, party colours aren t a factor. new democrat mp h l ne leblanc was in her constituency office in montreal when she noticed one of her arms was swollen.she didn t think much of it at first, but went to the walk - in clinic to get it checked out. she was told to go to emergency, where tests showed something was wrong.a couple of weeks later, the diagnosis came back she had cancer stage 2 hodgkin s lymphoma. everybody reacts differently, she recalls. i m usually somebody that is fairly emotional. i guess i went into a stage of being pragmatic. leblanc was diagnosed in april 2013 and started six months of chemotherapy shortly after, along with radiation treatments for two months.the 56 - year - old mp finished treatment about a year ago and is now in remission, calling herself very fortunate.instead of retreating from work during the treatment, the first - term mp dove right back into it to help her mentally fight the disease. politics was very helpful i just wanted to do my job, she says. it sort of helps you in a way to deal with the health issue because it takes your mind off what it is. i love my job. i love what i am doing. to me, it was a companion in helping me deal with the disease. leblanc was aware her prognosis was good and knew right away she wanted to run again. i plan to be with you in 2015 to run, she says. in my mind, that s something that was clear in my head. i m not god, i m not one who decides the fate of myself. but i was quite clear of my intentions. leblanc has also developed a friendship and connection with conservative mp and former cabinet minister keith ashfield, who has been fighting a recurrence of hodgkin s lymphoma. the two have wished each other well and talked about the illness. all mps, no matter which parties, we re all in this together. we re all in this for the same reason. we just differ on the way we would like to make canada better, she adds. we re all human. ottawa - orl ans conservative mp royal galipeau keeps count in his head of each day he has served as a parliamentarian.he s now at more than 3,250 days and counting. each day has been made all the more valuable since discovering in late 2013 he had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. i count the days forward to make sure each day counts, galipeau, 67, says from his office next to parliament hill.galipeau first discovered something was wrong when he broke a rib in october 2013 trying to stifle a sneeze, which i thought was strange, to say the least. he had a blood test done a few weeks later. when the results came back, his doctor told him to go immediately to the emergency department because he was on the verge of cardiac arrest. galipeau s blood was saturated with calcium and creatinine. after several days in hospital, doctors determined he had multiple myeloma, the second - most common blood cancer after non - hodgkin s lymphoma.in 2013, an estimated 2,500 canadians were diagnosed with multiple myeloma and 1,350 people died from it.doctors ordered him on dialysis for eight hours a day for more than a week, an extraordinary treatment but one his physicians deemed necessary.the amount of dialysis was gradually reduced over a couple of months, and now galipeau says his kidneys are working perfectly. i was never afraid. i ve always fought difficult fights and i ve never been afraid of difficult fights, and i knew this one was going to be difficult, he says. the diagnosis of multiple myeloma just came to me as a challenge amongst many other challenges. i was disciplined about dealing with it and continue to be. galipeau says he never missed a vote in the commons and worked from his hospital bed, signing documents and reviewing material.he s officially at retirement age, yet the soft - spoken galipeau says he looks forward to going to work for his constituents and hopes to do so beyond the 2015 election.galipeau was a longtime liberal who worked for grit mps mauril b langer and eug ne bellemare, before running for the conservatives in 2006 and winning the seat in what s traditionally been a liberal stronghold. i m not much for politics. i don t think politics. i have a job to do, i have an obligation, and i just do it. i was passionate about politics when i was a teenager, but i m not now, he says.so why does he want to run again i did offer the conservatives, if they thought they could have a better candidate, i d make room. but they didn t take me up on the invitation, he chuckles. i m not really running. i m just doing my job and there is no election until it s called next fall.

2015-01-02,The changing face of Vanier: What a difference a decade makes (with video),"valiquet, 55, is the executive director of quartier vanier. she has been involved in the association for 10 years, and served as executive director for seven of those. her role with the association ended on jan 1.the citizen sat down with valiquet to find out how vanier has changed throughout her years there. leaving was probably one of the hardest decisions in my life. i love this job, but i felt it was the right time for me to step down. i have served more than two terms as executive director. as a new term begins at city hall with new councillors, a new term will begin at the bias with new directors coming in. this is a good time for new leadership and for fresh ideas. when i arrived some 10 years ago, vanier had somehow been forgotten by the city. it was only a few years after amalgamation and although the main streets in the rest of the city were in full makeover, ours were not. our first goal was to clean the streets. in the first three years, the program got better our workers became better trained, police were more involved, and our residents were beginning to co - operate with police by calling in crimes. everyone was working better together.since then, we have expanded the boundaries of vanier to st. laurent boulevard, adding about 125 new businesses to our area. developments are now in the books for new buildings, offices, retail, and condos to be constructed over the next three to five years, with companies such as minto, domicile, bona, and longwood already having projects completed or in construction. in terms of programming, we expanded activities in economic development, safety and security, and focused on beautifying the area. we ve added large, red planters across the borough, which currently have christmas trees inside them. it s also important for a community to have good infrastructure such as benches, clean bus stops, lights and proper sidewalks, which we are still all working on. we ve also held investors seminars and annual events such as our farmers market. we started a safety and security program and hired students to walk the streets during the summer. these students became our ambassadors, spending each day talking to the merchants while cleaning and landscaping the streets. we were able to use them as a new communication tool to help connect with our merchants to understand their problems. plus, they helped with our graffiti removal program, which is the first of its kind in ottawa bias. removing graffiti quickly is important to the beautification of a community because if you remove new graffiti within 48 hours, the chances of it coming back are slim. a major problem was how do we re - brand vanier we have, along with the residents here, worked hard to enact change while keeping its heritage. we thought of the idea of re - branding each of our main roads while trying to keep everyone happy. we ended by naming beechwood avenue as the village, montreal road the french quarter, and mcarthur as the international avenue due to the large number of portuguese, arabic, east indian, and african businesses present there. the banners with these names will be hung on these streets starting in 2015.a it was, but now they come to us. our business recruitment strategy took a while to put together but we did our homework and produced results. there are now 25,000 people coming to work here in this commercial zone each day. the land is still affordable and is close to the core of the city. more and more young professionals are choosing to live here and young families are finding it attractive. by having lovely parks, schools, and cycling paths, it makes the area attractive, and that s good for business. big changes. there is a positive wind blowing here. i can see only great things as our merchants and property owners now recognize the potential and have started doing upgrades to their businesses. as long as we keep it clean and safe, working with the community and the police, it will continue to thrive and be a great place to live and work. the stigma of vanier as being dirty will be there for a long time but will go away when people begin to see the change. but we still must be vigilant. if you think that the problem has gone away, it has not. managing what we have in place now is crucial for the future. undoubtedly, land value is going to increase. we re in close proximity to the downtown core. in fact, i like to think we re downtown east. vanier is going to find itself more in demand soon. it will become tougher to invest in, so now is the right time. the high prices of downtown real estate will soon spill over as we have seen in areas like westboro and west wellington. its history and geography, architecture and eclectic nature, diverse population, and the culture of the francophone community. i ve always used the analogy vanier is a little city in a big city when describing it to someone who has never been. it s always had that little village feel while still being able to sit right in the middle of the city."

2015-01-02,Crowley: Sir John A. Macdonald an underrated statesman,"as william faulkner wrote, the past is never dead. it s not even past. truer words were never spoken as we enter 2015, the 200th anniversary of the birth of sir john a. macdonald, canada s principal founder and first prime minister.those who think that sir john s only legacy to canada is a few statues around the country and a poor likeness on the 10 dollar bill do not understand that the very warp and weft of this country are made up of threads drawn from this man s strategic and tactical genius. out of the unpromising materials of thinly - populated and mutually antagonistic british colonies unloved by london and coveted by washington, riven by racial and linguistic disputes, he distilled the ideas, politics and institutions that today place us at the forefront of the nations of the world. we are his legacy.in his magisterial new history of canada, conrad black does not exaggerate when he asserts that, had canada not been so small at the outset, macdonald s feat would have undoubtedly won him the acclaim history accords to the other great statesmen of the 19th century lincoln, palmerston, disraeli, gladstone, salisbury, cavour and bismarck. there is still time for history to be revised.much as he admired the united states and its founders vision he carried his copy of the federalist papers with him to the conferences that led to confederation he saw the weaknesses of their creation, not least in the sanguinary civil war that had just wracked their great republic. chief among those defects was a constitution that gave too much power to the states and too little to the federal government with the result that the centre could not hold.to make a nation out of british north americans, therefore, he knew that he had to create for them the instruments of nationhood and not merely project into the future the local and parochial interests of the individual colonies. accordingly, he defended the idea of a powerful national government and parliament that would represent and unite all canadians and be the instrument of the construction of a national consciousness, pride and action. he had to compromise and accept the creation of provinces independent of ottawa, but if you read the actual text of the british north america act subsequently and prosaically renamed the constitution act 1867 he clearly won his point and ottawa was intended to be by far the more powerful agent of canadians political will.ignorant and busybody judges along with ottawa s political timidity, including in the face of separatist provocations in quebec, have watered down sir john a. s wine, but even in that insipid tipple you can still detect the full - bodied flavour that fuelled this man and his vision. and those politicians who have known how to tap into canadians desire to rise above petty regional squabbles and articulate what canada could be if it transcended parochialism have often found themselves richly rewarded. that is one of macdonald s lurking legacies.but there was more. he didn t just want a nation. he wanted a nation that would preserve and promote a way of life that he believed had proven its superiority over all others. that meant embracing a society of freedom. peace, order and good government are not boring and uninspiring; they are the wellspring of progress. the constitution similar in principle to that of the united kingdom promised by the bna act was one based on the freedom of the individual, limited government, an independent judiciary, the rule of law and a powerful civil society. those who think the charter introduced rights into canada fail to grasp how deeply infused our founding institutions were with those values, thanks in large part to macdonald.on his birthday january 11 and throughout macdonald s 200th anniversary year, canadians might well celebrate their impressive present and brilliant potential by raising a toast to our first prime minister. he lives on in us."

2015-01-02,New law to put illegal downloaders on notice,"illegal downloaders may start finding notices in their inboxes thanks to new federal copyright laws that came into effect january 1.the letters will inform those who illegally download movies, shows, music and other copyrighted materials of their copyright transgression as required by the canadian government s .as of january 1, internet service providers are legally required to forward their customers any notice the isps receive from a copyright holder about an alleged act of infringement. this gives them a safe harbour from liability, according to michael geist, a law professor at university of ottawa and privacy expert.rights holders, such as a movie studio, may monitor sites where their content is being downloaded or shared without consent. they track the internet protocol ip addresses of those who have pirated copyrighted material and send a notice to their internet providers.the government states these notices must be in writing, with the copyright holder s name and address, it must identify the illegally downloaded material, and include the ip address along with the time and date of the alleged activity. it s the most efficient and most responsible method for addressing the issue, said jake enwright, press secretary for minister of industry james moore.notices of copyright infringement aren t a new thing for canadian isps, which have been forwarding them onto their customers for more than 10 years, according to jennifer kett, a spokeswoman for rogers communications. the new legal requirement won t change how we forward the notice to our customers, kett said.another aspect of the notice and notice regime is that isps must also retain records of these notices for a minimum of six months to one year, just in case a copyright owner decides to file a lawsuit. we re complying with the law, sending notifications to affected customers and informing content owners those notices have been delivered, but with no customer identification, said bell spokeswoman jacqueline michelis.rogers also assures its customers that they do not disclose the identity of the person to the copyright holder without a court order.if a rights holder does pursue legal action, they have to get a court order to obtain the identity of the subscriber, go through the process of formally suing them, and the most they can sue them for is capped at 5,000, explains geist. for someone who s alleged to have downloaded a television show that retails for 99 cents would presumably try to make the claim that the actual damage here is nominal, nothing close to the maximum, he said.geist states that people shouldn t think this is a licence to infringe but it s a way for the government to strike a balance between the rights of copyright holders while limiting the penalties of illegal downloaders. in the you.s., some downloaders have been ordered to pay millions of dollars in fines.for now, canadians don t have to be concerned about their private information being released to copyright holders, but, to avoid getting their first notice, they may hesitate before illegally downloading a new movie."
2015-01-02,Letter: Gallery attendance can rise,"re , december 19.national gallery director marc mayer was optimistic that the gallery s dropping attendance would start to rise one day. his recent letter was in response to articles that made reference to possibly why these numbers were getting lower.i just want to say that a sudden rise seems to have taken place already. we went to the gallery on sunday, december 28. there was a line - up to buy tickets, even at the members desk. we are members and usually we walk up to the desk and get instant service. the complimentary coat - check had a line up too. the bookshop was crowded with buyers. the caf was busy too.we went to see the jack bush exhibition for the second time and there were bigger crowds there than at our previous visit. there were fewer crowds at the photography exhibit, and that was good as one could study the pictures without having to push one s way to get a good view. we strolled into the escher exhibition and that was packed. so much so, that we said let s come back on another day. so there was no blockbuster show of van gogh, monet or picasso, just that guy, known only by his surname, who has lots of calendars on sale every year, with those funny optical illusions. yes, maurits cornelis escher seemed to be the drawing card that had boosted the attendance.we trust that this success does not mean that calendar - related shows will become the mainstay of the shows at the gallery. i do not think that mayer will have shows in the future featuring well - known artists like thomas kinkade, maud lewis, beryl cook, terry redlin and susan winget. but, they are immensely popular and in some businesses getting people in the door is the only objective. and both pop art and popular art must have places to be shown."

2015-01-03,What some notable Ottawa folks have to say about their secret to happiness," my secret to happiness it s a huge question that will continue to be asked until the end of time by all. for me, it s about having a vocation that allows me to express myself through music with all that it entails emotion, poetry, sound, technique, communication, physicality. it s about the work that goes into learning a new piece of music that is completely humbling, inspiring and satisfying.that, coupled with my love for laughter, trying to do it every day and communication with my family every day at least one facetime to my mother in australia, no matter which country i happen to be in and inspiration from my husband. he is my partner in life and music, and the musical telepathy that we share is so fulfilling. i am constantly learning from others, including non - musician friends. knowing wonderful people from other walks of life filters into my cello playing without even knowing it. in the peripatetic lifestyle that i lead, never being home, always on tour, performing, i rely on people to keep me full and charged up. also, being physical with exercise makes me ecstatic. any day i can do something that won t hurt my hands is great. sweat thrills me. what makes me happy is really enjoying what i do every day. running a restaurant and being a chef appeals to my creative side and in a way it defines who i am or at least has come to define me. that being said, operating a restaurant is very demanding at work at 8 30 a.m. until 9 30 p.m., if i m lucky and on the go all day. so every day i like to take a moment and do something that is not for the restaurant. for example, on tuesdays and thursdays i sneak out like a bandit and go down to the parkdale food centre in my neighbourhood, drop off some food and see what is going on. they ve recently moved into a new space at 30 rosemount ave. in the old knights of columbus building near connaught public school. the space has been beautifully restored and is really dynamic. every once in a while, they let me come and mess up their kitchen and cook with some of the clients. i get to show them some cooking techniques they can try at home and then we all come together and break bread at a communal table and eat what we have created together. this i find immensely gratifying and humbling which oddly makes me happy. sunday, my day off, sophie and i go to the library where we have almost every book at our disposal and we can both indulge in our passion for reading. i love to travel and even when i can t go far we ll go to kingston or upstate new york wherever and stay in a cheap no - tell motel and see how other people live. i guess my secret to keeping happy would have to be keeping it simple, simplicity rocks. happiness the elusive emotion that we re all looking for and we ultimately find right in front of us or perhaps better said, right inside ourselves. i try to focus on a fairly simple balance between gratitude and generosity. i m grateful for the loved ones in my life, that i m healthy and how fortunate i am to be a photographer who can help people with my work. i also believe happiness comes from living an honest and humble life being honest with yourself and with others, and from appreciating all of life s many wonderful gifts. in times when i haven t been my happiest, i have done my best to help people who are less fortunate. it s amazing how quickly you forget your own woes when helping others. gratitude and generosity appreciate what you have and give to others who have less. there s no secret. i ve been through the wringer when it comes to dealing with certain things. after getting blown up and losing my legs how do you stay positive one of my biggest things is i don t dwell on things that don t go my way. that s where i believe what s in front of you should make you happy because what s behind you shouldn t be what s making you sad. for me it s about what can i do to make myself happy and worry about tomorrow and not yesterday. the reason i have so much to say about the subject is because of what i went through. having my entire identity erased in a flash with that explosion, caused me to do a lot of soul searching. i didn t want to be that depressed, sad, lame, old guy. i don t want to be identified by the day that land mine went off. i want to be known for what i accomplish after. i think it s community. if we re surrounded by people who are fortunate and we have a christmas party with friends and family, we can say to them that instead of bringing a bottle of wine, why don t we bring something for the mission. give it to people who need something instead of buying another bottle of booze. i think even a handshake and saying hello to people on the street is good. in the running community we get kind of spoiled because you re out for a run on the canal and it doesn t matter if you re a doctor, lawyer, or whether you re homeless or a recovering alcoholic. when you say hi to someone on the canal they generally say hi back and give you a wave. you re part of that same community and community is something that s lacking for a lot of people either social, economic, race or otherwise. just trying to maybe take that extra step to say hello to people or have a nice day. i always feel good when someone says that on the canal so i always try to pay that forward. as a health coach, i aspire to inspire positive change by living the truth of my words. having lived though my own adversities i ve accomplished many amazing fitness goals and have discovered along the way that the secret to success is kindness. kindness not only of others, but of self can lead anyone down the path of success towards any goal. every day i make kind choices that reinforce the love i have for myself. my body demonstrates that it can accomplish many things and like a seed, i nourish it with quality food and water, offer it plenty of movement and rest. gratitude is also a part of my daily affirmations, without it i would not recognize victories big or small, and gain a sense of pride for reaching goals. i would define health as a physical manifestation of our thoughts and actions. a healthy body is a happy body and the path to achieve them is to become empowered by actions. when faced with choices, i chose to first honour myself and revel in the wisdom that i am making kind choices that originate from a place of love.

2015-01-03,Canadian firms hurt by Ukraine crisis - exports to Russia plummet as Moscow strikes back against Canadian sanctions,"canadian exporters stung by russia s currency crisis and its retaliatory sanctions against the west wonder what 2015 will hold for a market filled with promise less than 12 months ago, writes here is the rest of article companies from farm - equipment manufacturers to pork producers spent much of 2014 adjusting to the economic instability in russia, a country that bought 563 - million worth of canada s agricultural exports in 2012.for some firms, the first - half of 2014 had the hallmark of a banner year and then sales evaporated.a senior executive for one of canada s biggest exporters to russia said his company did about 250 - million in annual business there in recent years, mostly selling frozen pork products.olymel, a pork and poultry processor and distributor, appeared on track for its best year yet in russia after more than two decades of working there, said richard davies, the company s senior vice - president of sales and marketing.but in august, russia banned meat products and other goods from countries such as canada in retaliation for financial sanctions by the western countries. we knew the ban was potentially going to come, but we certainly didn t expect it to unravel as quickly and as strongly as it did, davies said in an interview. obviously, the embargo in august had a significant impact on us and basically the canadian and north american pork market, for that matter. last march, canada and some of its allies sought to punish russia for its annexation of crimea and its provocative military activity in eastern ukraine. they imposed a number of sanctions against russia and its supporters.russia struck back by slapping a ban on meat, seafood, milk and dairy products, fruit and vegetables from canada, the you.s., the european union, and other countries.the canadian hog industry exported more than 490 - million worth of pork products to russia in 2012, according to canada pork international.signs of the impact have already begun to surface in the trade data.the most - recent statistics canada figures show exports of fresh, chilled or frozen pork to russia totalled 7 - million for the months of august, september and october, 2014. by comparison, the same three - month stretch in 2013 saw canadian firms send 64 - million worth of those products to russia.in another major area, statistics canada didn t record any canadian exports of crustaceans to russia from august to october, 2014, after it yielded 16.1 - million for the same three - month period in 2013. canadian sales of frozen fish excluding fillets were 750,000 between august and october, 2014, down from nearly 19 - million over those months a year earlier.davies said the pork producers have redirected some of their products into existing markets, but that has driven down prices. he added that some 2014 losses were offset by price increases after a virus outbreak killed millions of piglets in the united states.he has no idea what s next for russian - canadian trade, though he fears ottawa s condemnation of russia could hurt relations even if the sanctions are lifted.prime minister stephen harper and conservative mps have been a vocal critics of russian president vladimir putin for months. the prime minister s office has said harper told putin to get out of ukraine to his face when the two met at the g20 summit in australia in november. my personal is view is it s just too loud, too much rhetoric for the political weight we carry in the grand scheme of things in the world political map, davies said. i think long term that might have a negative impact when eventually things tend towards coming to normal. i think we might be in the penalty box for a little longer than we should. a spokesman for foreign affairs minister john baird reiterated the government s message the sanctions against russia and its supporters were made with careful consideration of the potential impact they would have on canadian business interests. we will continue sending the message to russia that its aggression against ukraine is unacceptable, adam hodge said in an e - mail.today, the turmoil in russia reaches far beyond international sanctions. the country s falling currency the ruble and the plunge in oil prices have thrown it into crisis.the downturn has even affected sectors that were not targeted by the kremlin s embargo. so, you were asking about business in russia there isn t any, said greg archibald, president of saskatchewan farming machinery manufacturer schulte industries ltd. we ve built up some pretty good sales over there. last year was a booming year and this year we were expecting to get better and then it just stopped. even though russia hasn t banned farming equipment sales, archibald said the country s economic problems have ensured schulte hasn t sold anything in the country for six months.the company, he said, saw half a million dollars in orders cancelled in one day. it has been working to boost sales in other markets, such as germany, south africa, china and australia, he added.above all, however, archibald said he worries about farmers caught in the middle of the violence and the humanitarian crisis linked to the political unrest. it s just difficult over there for the whole bunch of them, said archibald, whose company has considered russia a key market for more than a decade and has deep ties to people in the region. i feel for them. it s not good for us, but we ll live we ll survive. but it s difficult and i think it s probably going to be a few years before they work themselves out of it. derek lothian, vice - president of canadian manufacturers exporters, predicts the business challenges in russia to remain in place for all of 2015 at least.lothian said the situation has been compounded because the cash - strapped russian government has also limited subsidies, particularly to its agricultural sector. russia s purchasing power is, quite frankly, considerably diminished and that translates into dampened demand for canadian products, he said.the chief executive of manitoba - based hog producer hylife ltd. said that at this time of year, canadian companies like his usually enjoy russia s constant, year - round demand for pork products. north american demand for hams typically drops off after christmas, grant lazaruk said. if russia was open today, it would probably represent 25 per cent of our sales, said lazaruk, who has maintained good relations with his russian clients so that hylife s ready for the market s reopening whenever that might be.lazaruk even received christmas cards from them, though he said it remains unclear what will happen in 2015."

2015-01-03,Father of fighter pilot captured by ISIL asks them to treat him well,"the father of the jordanian pilot captured by the islamic state group appealed saturday to the militants to treat his son well and with respect, the writes.here is the rest of the article the pilot, 1st lt. mu ath al - kaseasbeh, was taken captive on december 24 after his f - 16 fighter jet crashed near the extremists de facto capital of raqqa in northern syria. the 26 - year - old jordanian is the first known foreign military pilot to fall into the militants hands since the you.s. - led international coalition began its aerial campaign against the is in september.speaking to reporters from his home village of aii in central jordan, the pilot s father, safi yousef al - kaseasbeh, said saturday that he is confident that his son is in safe hands in a place where he is respected. i want to tell our brothers in the islamic state that mu ath is your son same as he is our son, al - kaseasbeh said. my message to them on this day, the birthday of the prophet muhammad, is that they treat him in a good way, and to treat him as a guest. the younger al - kaseasbeh was carrying out airstrikes against the militants when his warplane went down.in its monthly magazine, the islamic state group published what it said was an interview with al - kaseasbeh in which the pilot says he was shot down by a heat - seeking missile. that version contradicts statements from the united states, which has denied that the militants downed the jordanian s aircraft.other than the purported interview, there has been no word on al - kaseasbeh or his fate.the islamic state group follows an extremist version of islam that considers rivals, even some fellow sunni muslims, as apostates, and the group has executed captured iraqi and syrian muslim soldiers in the past. still, the group may want to negotiate a prisoner swap or other concessions from jordan."
2015-01-03,Ottawa protesters show support for detained Sikhs in India,"protesters from ontario and quebec rallied in ottawa on a chilly friday to demand the release of sikhs who they say are being illegally detained in indian jails.in a protest on the sidewalk in front of the indian high commission, the crowd of about 300 waved flags and signs, chanted and spoke out in anger against the indian government.the rally was organized to support bhai gurbaksh singh khalsa, a sikh activist who has been on a hunger strike in india since november 14 to demand the release of seven sikhs who continue to be detained after completing sentences.the rally marked the 50th day of khalsa s hunger strike. we need justice, said amrita kaur, 13, who travelled from her home in montreal for the protest. the indian government is keeping these guys in jail because they are sikh. they don t want them out. although sikhs are a religious minority in india, sikhism has numerous followers elsewhere. as a result, rallies and hunger strikes supporting khlasa have been occurring all across the world.ottawa sikhs have been staging a chain hunger strike since december 22, and will continue to do so for the next few weeks, said manohar singh bal, an organizer of the rally. the strike takes place each day from 11 a.m. to 5 30 p.m. in front of the high commission. they are mostly symbolic, said bal, as he took part in the protest. it is a message to the indian government from canadian sikhs that we are with this fellow, and that india needs to treat the sikhs better and address their concerns. however, for bal, this is an issue that affects more than sikhs. this is a human rights issue, says bal. no matter where this is happening in the world, if it s wrong, then it is wrong. a representative at the indian high commission refused to comment."

2015-01-03,Peter Loewen: The 2015 election season is upon us,"there was no starting gun, but the federal election has begun. between now and october, there will be another budget, a high - profile trial, a summer of touring and glad - handing, and five party leaders fighting for their political lives.the prospects for an early election are slim. the prime minister is comfortable governing. if this governing is unhindered by the opposition, it is also free of any pretence for forcing an early election. further, the prime minister has likely reasoned that he is better going into the next election with the budget balanced or near balance and with a new suite of tax cuts than he is with the mere promise of these things.there is reason for this confidence. stephen harper s polling numbers have been slowly but steadily rising. according to three - hundred eight, the pm has nearly pulled even with trudeau s liberals. if this seems unremarkable, consider that the gap between these parties reached 12 points at the end of the summer. this increase is neither ephemeral or happenstance. ipsos, who have polled most extensively and consistently, show that harper s comeback occurred before the attacks in ottawa, though these surely increased voters estimation. instead, questions about alternatives have steadily if slowly accumulated, and harper worked through substantial challenges.for harper, two challenges remain. first, the decline in oil prices signals both short - term and long - term problems. substantial shortfalls in federal revenues and provincial royalty revenues in alberta can measurably change short - term revenue outlooks. the budget can be balanced, but the task is now more difficult. the longer - term challenges of capitalizing on the oil sands will remain whoever wins the next election.second, the trial of mike duffy will pose problems for the prime minister. to be sure, harper s position appears stronger than a year ago. there are no charges for nigel wright. but whatever the facts of the case, shifted focus to this episode sullies all involved. there will surely be new questions for harper to answer.for tom mulcair, the first challenge is purely strategic. mulcair and harper share an interest that the next election be framed as a choice between experience and inexperience. but experience easily looks like careerism, and voters can rightfully prefer new faces to old ones. add to this the difficulty of esteeming harper s experience while condemning the results of his experience. how do mulcair and harper praise each other s attributes while criticizing their policies it is possible, but it is not easy.the second challenge is purely organizational. the last election might give pause to those who suggest that on - the - ground organization is required to win elections. the new democrats showed that on - the - ground candidates are not even a necessity. but this trick is not easily repeated, and the new democrats have substantial work to do in organizing their party across the country. mulcair s discipline is in not in question, but that of his larger party is, most certainly.justin trudeau s party has shown impressive organization, nominations are underway, and strong candidates are winning the nods. his own industry is much to be admired, though he is far from displaying the rhetorical discipline required in a campaign. most importantly, it is not yet clear that his party has found a way to at once occupy a centrist position and present distinct policy alternatives. a grab - bag of policies will not do. remember the last liberal campaign offering, called the family pack no you re not alone.mulcair and trudeau will, from now to october, be asked to explain what they would do in the event of a tory minority. would they form a coalition to replace the conservative government or would they allow it to govern, likely with the new democrats supporting the government issue by issue coalitions are entirely constitutional and defensible. but this does not mean that voters have to like or support coalition governments or that parties can avoid answering questions about these arrangements.there is ample time for trudeau to stake out his positions, for mulcair to organize his party, and for the prime minister to take his last stand. there is also ample time for voters to ask questions and have them answered."
2015-01-03,U.S. hits North Korea with new sanctions over alleged cyber attack on Sony,"opening a new front in its cyber spat with north korea, the united states slapped new sanctions friday on government officials and the north s defence industry in its first public act of retribution for a cyber attack against sony, the writes.here is the rest of the article despite lingering doubts by the cyber community, the you.s. insisted that north korea was to blame.the white house warned that this was just the opening salvo in the you.s. response.while the fresh sanctions will have limited effect north korea already is under tough you.s. sanctions over its nuclear program american officials portrayed the move as a swift and decisive response to north korean behavior they said had gone far over the line. never before has the you.s. imposed sanctions on another nation in direct retaliation for a cyberattack on an american company. the order is not targeted at the people of north korea, but rather is aimed at the government of north korea and its activities that threaten the united states and others, president barack obama wrote in a letter to house and senate leaders.with this round of sanctions, the you.s. also put north korea on notice that payback need not be limited to those who perpetrated the attack.the 10 north koreans singled out for sanctions didn t necessarily have anything to do with the attack on sony, senior you.s. officials said. anyone who works for or helps north korea s government is now fair game, said the officials especially north korea s defense sector and spying operations.the sanctions also apply to three organizations closely tied to north korea s government the country s primary intelligence agency, a state - owned arms dealer that exports missile and weapons technology, and the korea tangun trading corp., which supports defense research. all three of those entities were already subject to you.s. sanctions, so friday s move against those groups appeared primarily symbolic.obama has also warned pyongyang that the you.s. is considering whether to put north korea back on its list of state sponsors of terrorism, which could jeopardize aid to north korea on a global scale. beyond that, it s unclear what additional penalties the you.s. has in its arsenal.north korea has denied involvement in the cyberattack, which led to the disclosure of tens of thousands of confidential sony emails and business files, then escalated to threats of terrorist attacks against movie theaters. many cybersecurity experts have said it s entirely possible that hackers or even sony insiders could be the culprits, not north korea, and questioned how the fbi can point the finger so conclusively.senior you.s. officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, dismissed those arguments and said independent experts don t have access to the same classified information as the fbi. we stand firmly behind our call that the dprk was behind the attacks on sony, one official said, using an acronym for the north s official name, the democratic people s republic of korea.those sanctioned include north koreans representing the country s interests in iran, russia and syria. any assets they have in the you.s. will be frozen, and they ll be barred from using the you.s. financial system. americans will be prohibited from doing business with them, the treasury department said.at the united nations, no one answered the phone at north korea s you.n. mission, and calls to a diplomat there were not answered. sony, too, declined to comment.while denying any role in a cyberattack, north korea has expressed fury over the sony comedy flick the interview, which depicts the fictional assassination of north korean leader kim jong un. sony initially called off the film s release after movie theaters decided not to show the film. after president barack obama criticized that decision, sony decided to release the film in limited theaters and online.the white house called the sanctions the first aspect of our response to the sony attack a declaration that raised fresh questions about who was behind a nearly 10 - hour shutdown of north korean websites last week. the shutdown prompted a blunt response from north korea s powerful national defense commission, which blamed the you.s. and hurled racial slurs at obama, calling him a reckless monkey in a tropical forest. despite widespread speculation, the you.s. never said whether it was responsible for shutting down north korea s internet. but north korea had a blunt response. its powerful national defense commission blamed the outage directly on the you.s. and hurled racial slurs at obama, calling him a reckless monkey in a tropical forest. on friday, you.s. officials still wouldn t say who was responsible. they pointed out that there had been media reports suggesting north korea shut down its own internet.north korea and the you.s. remain technically in a state of war because the 1950 -

2015-01-03,Ottawa girls hockey league takes the game to Lowertown (with video),"the ottawa girls hockey association has launched a program to expand the sport by taking the game to lowertown, where financial and cultural barriers often stand in the way of girls getting involved in canada s game. tim b langer, the ogha s vice - president of hockey operations, spoke recently with the citizen s about the initiative, which takes to the ice in january. here s an edited version of their conversation we know that the number of kids playing hockey in canada is going down and that the biggest problem is the cost. we re determined to grow girls hockey and the ottawa girls hockey association. so we decided to do that by trying to help those families that can t afford to play. we partnered with these two schools, york street public and cole sainte - anne, because they re in a neighbourhood where not a lot of girls play hockey.the sens foundation has built a new outdoor rink in the neighbourhood at jules morin park. we felt that it offered the perfect opportunity there s no need for transportation, the girls go to school right across the street. so if we can provide them with equipment and instruction and there s no cost to this this can help grow the game, especially the girl s game.so we should have about 40 girls when we have our first official on - ice session on january 14.we ran an equipment donation drive within the ogha and the association found a way to get the extra helmets and jills pelvic protectors we needed. we reached out, as well, to the sens foundation and the university of ottawa gee - gees women s hockey team for used equipment. we managed to come up with enough equipment for everybody this year. it means all of the girls who participate in the program will be given a hockey bag and equipment and it will be theirs to keep.can we keep doing that every year we re not sure yet. but our first call - out was really well - received.because we know there will be a lot of different skill levels some kids will have skated, some not we ll tier them into three groups. some will be complete beginners, some with a few skills, some more advanced. we ll run the same drills, but it will allow the kids to go at their own pace. we ll do three different stations one will be on the skating stride, one will be stops and starts, and one will be stickhandling. it won t all be just skating we re hoping to have a little scrimmage at the end.all of the instructors will be volunteers from our league competitive and house league coaches and players. we re hoping to be able to go six or seven weeks, but it will depend on the weather because we re using an outdoor rink.we have a lot of families in this neighbourhood that are new to canada and some of them have never been associated with hockey their parents have never played. a lot of the girls come from countries where there s no snow. so we felt it was important to introduce them to the game and give them a taste of what it s all about. there are some great athletes here and we d like to keep them involved in sports, particularly in girls hockey.what we really hope is that the kids learn and develop and have fun doing this. and hopefully, some of them will continue to play hockey with us next year."
2015-01-03,Seasonal flu hits Ottawa hard,"flu season is hitting ottawa with a wallop this year two local deaths have been attributed to it and 20 area retirement homes and long - term care centres are dealing with ongoing outbreaks.the majority of local cases are influenza a, h3n2, which is an aggressive strain and one that isn t fully prevented by the vaccine, although the vaccine might lessen symptoms.as of friday, there had been 149 lab confirmed cases in ottawa since the flu season began, according to ottawa public health, the majority among people 65 and older. twenty three of those cases 14 of them in patients over 65 were severe enough to require hospitalization.and two people one over 65 and one between the ages of 20 and 64 have died as a result of the flu. there have been 19 flu - related deaths in the province.it is a severe flu season throughout north america, partly due to the aggressiveness of the dominant strain and partly because of changes in the virus, which means the seasonal flu vaccine does not offer complete protection from it.despite that mismatch, ottawa health officials say the vaccine continues to be the best method of protection against the flu. in years where there has been an h3n2 mismatch, the flu vaccine has been found to offer some cross protection against the drifted strain, ottawa public health said in a release. it also prevents against other strains.the virus h3n2 causes more severe illness, hospitalization and death, primarily among the elderly but also in infants, young children, pregnant women and persons with chronic medical conditions, according to a spokeswoman for ottawa public health.flu outbreaks at institutions such as long - term care homes must be reported to public health officials who recommend outbreak control measures such as limiting visitors until the outbreak is under control.the number of lab - confirmed cases in ottawa is believed to represent hundreds more that have not been tested. there are more flu cases in ottawa than last year this time, but slightly less than two years ago when the city also saw a severe flu season. a lag in data means the number of ottawa cases is likely higher than the numbers suggest.as of last week, 15 children had died in the you.s. as a result of the flu, which officials there said was on the verge of an epidemic.there are also other, non - influenza, respiratory outbreaks at some retirement and long - term care homes in ottawa.about 57 per cent of ottawa adults have received the seasonal flu vaccine in the 2013 - 2014 season. health officials say getting the vaccine as well as hand - washing, covering coughs and sneezes and avoiding crowds if you are sick are the best ways to prevent spread of the flu.epayne ottawacitizen.com"
2015-01-03,Q&amp;A: Sen. Vern White on his love of policing and the lure of politics (with video),"former ottawa police chief vern white is approaching his third anniversary as a conservative senator. he recently spoke with ian macleod about homegrown terrorism, parliament hill security, and the public s often unflattering view of federal politicians. he also revealed what may be his next career move.a. that they don t work hard. it s a bit of a fallacy. i see how they work.a. because people only hear about the 16 glass of orange juice an expense claimed by former cabinet minister bev oda . they don t hear about the 22 - hour flight to give three speeches and 22 hours to get back. i have to tell you, that s not exactly the type of flying around the world that i like to do.the vast majority of people here come to work hard to make a difference. i look at senators they re not travelling here from fort st. john, whitehorse, st. john s, gander, cape breton for a break. they arrive here late at night or early in the morning.a. i saw parliamentary politics as one large team. but instead, it s really a whole bunch of players that get together regularly to form a team. it s a little more independent in the things you do. so i don t know that i realized how much independence you would have. the upside is that it has allowed me to do some things in my community that i ve loved doing. i ve been able to focus some energy around drug addiction, mental health youth issues in the city and am still very engaged with a lot of the work that is done around that.a. the team, the people around you. that sounds like something alfie former senators captain daniel alfredsson would say, but it s true. when you re in that environment, whether you re on the first line or the fourth line, you feel like you are making a difference. i loved every day of policing. i loved the pace almost an addiction comes with that adrenalin, that go, go, go. i miss that as well. current police chief bill blair steps down in april. a. you know what, that would interest me, primarily because i love a challenge. for me it would have to be about fit. fit means, what do they toronto s police services board expect there s things i don t bring to that job and there s things i do bring. if it s the things that i have in my arsenal, then great, i d love to do that. but if not, it s not personal.it is a bit of a tipping point for toronto police right now.a. they have a lot on their back, the g20 controversy over police tactics toward protesters kind of coming all the way to now. how that s managed with the next chief, i think will be extremely important. i think a re - engagement strategy with the community for the new chief is going to be important, expectations of the community.in toronto, it s going to come down to what they need and whether or not i can fulfil that and whether they see me as the one who can deliver.a. that s always a tough question. i ve thought about it a lot. if i were to, it would have to be where i live kanata . i m in gordon o connor s riding carleton - mississippi - mills , so if i was to run, would it be this time around that s a discussion i would have to have both with my family and that community.a. safe border issues and the manner in which we re going to manage some of the concerns we have around terrorism, radicalization, de - radicalization. white sits on the senate s national security and defence committee .canada has been extremely successful over the past 13 years. we took down a couple of groups in ottawa , i was in durham when we took down the toronto 18. we ve been very successful at disrupting, dismantling, arresting and prosecuting those people, but some of that has been luck on our part. it s important going forward that we have renewed energy focused on that.a. i support fully things like removing passports. it does send a message to people, that the passport, you don t really own that, we can take it from you and we will keep you from going other places.in australia it s against the law to go fight for anybody in any other country. i think having some discussions around whether that is valuable for us, whether we can institute some type of legislation to stop that would be worthwhile .right now we have a no - fly list when it comes to terrorism. i think we need to have a discussion on will - fly lists, individuals who are involved in the sex trade in countries where young people are being trafficked and used. we need to start targeting those individuals. we know who they are, often.it s easy to point fingers and say this is what s happening and where it s happening. i think it s actually difficult to be clear on where it s happening.in reality, radicalization almost never happens in the absence of a face - to - face contact with someone promoting extremism . it does take that personal engagement. you re not going to watch the internet and say, that s it, i m in, isis here i come. i think we should be targeting our energy on those somebodies out there who are doing the direct recruiting .my biggest concern right now is, do we have the resources to focus energy on radicalized people out there that are concerning us i m not convinced we have those resources.a. i think we have enough laws. we need to be more engaged with the laws we have and maybe in particular around lawful access. there are cellphones out there today that even the companies who make them can t break into them. well, that s a concern of mine. i m not talking about entering someone s domain without lawful authorities, affidavits before judges, all that. but we need to have some tweaking in those laws that allow us access to that information.what i am hearing from police agencies, is that the amount of resources having to be pushed into counter - terrorism work right now means there s other work not getting done, in particular organized crime investigations. i m not sure we can afford to do that.having two or three people killed in montreal who are known gang members may not impact you now, until they blow up a car that kills three innocent people. so that is one of our challenges.a. i welcome and look forward to the openness of parliament hill for canadians. i m proud of the fact that we have people playing frisbee on our front lawn. but we do need to have some security screening at wellington street as you come onto the hill. what that looks like i m not exactly sure, but there needs to be some engagement.it doesn t stop people from coming, lawful protests will still occur. but i do think we need to have that level of protection at wellington, so that between wellington and the hill there is that freedom still.a. he should never have got through the front door. when i was the chief of durham regional police , we had two nuclear power plants, pickering and darlington . our focus was on taking people down at the fence. my perspective is people shouldn t get past the wellington street entrance and, if they do, they shouldn t get past the lawn and, if they do, they shouldn t get past the door.so you have three opportunities to take down an armed intruder. they absolutely should never get inside these buildings, it should not happen."

2015-01-04,"After 15 years of charitable giving, David Sweanor goes public with his philanthropy","over the past 15 years, david sweanor has quietly donated more than 1 million to the community foundation of ottawa. quietly is the operative word his donations to a foundation fund named after his children, adam and rachel, have always been anonymous.until now. sweanor has decided to discard his cloak of anonymity in hopes of inspiring others to follow his example. if you re doing a good deed, it warms your soul to know that you are, says the ottawa lawyer and public health expert. but if other people are aware that you are, maybe they re more likely to do a good deed. the 59 - year - old sweanor is one of the community foundation s most eclectic donors. he thinks very outside the box in his giving, and he s very engaged and very involved in it, says iona green, a foundation spokeswoman. he s very much about leaving a better world for his kids. over the years, the adam and rachel fund one of about 700 community foundation donor funds has distributed more than 800,000 to a wide range of local, national and international causes, green says.sweanor, an adjunct professor of law at the university of ottawa, doesn t shrink from controversy. he spent much of his working life in the front lines of the fight against smoking, but he thinks e - cigarettes could be one of the biggest breakthroughs ever in public health an unfashionable view in many anti - smoking circles.he regularly works with and donates to ngos, but he says too many are inefficient and wasteful, led by people interested mostly in foreign travel and attending fancy dinners. some of them see donors the way jesse james saw banks, he observes. you have to watch out for that. he s a passionate cyclist who has put about 64,000 kilometres on his carbon fibre bicycle since 2010 and thinks nothing of knocking off 170 - kilometre rides before lunch. in 2010, he challenged himself to do 100 rides over 100 miles. i got in 102, he says.when sweanor set up his family fund with the community foundation in 2001, he decided to remain anonymous, largely to protect his children. he worried that going public might affect their social lives, attracting people more interested in their father s money.he embraced anonymity for other reasons, as well. the highest level of gift - giving is where you expect absolutely nothing in return, he says. you re saying, i m doing this because i think it s valuable. i m not doing it for some ego reason.' anonymous donations also don t tempt successful charities to change what they re doing in order to cater to a major benefactor. as an added bonus, sweanor s mailbox isn t full of begging letters from charities. i m spared that. but there s a major downside to anonymous philanthropy, sweanor says. you don t end up encouraging other people to do things. they don t hear the personal stories of the people involved. you ve got a lot of really uplifting stories from very bright, committed people who are making a heck of a difference in the community, he says. you ve got all these people who, in some ways, are living a bit of a secret life. wouldn t it be neat if everybody would just come out now that sweanor s children are young adults, he s less concerned about potential harm to them. and now he can talk openly about what he does and why he does it. there are people that want to be involved but just don t know how. sweanor says he feels passionate about a whole lot of issues. i m very interested in stuff that might be too controversial for others, things like drug harm reduction programs. his family fund has supported projects promoting healthy lifestyles, paid for scholarships and training for young people, invested in issues of mental health, and supported international efforts by groups such as healthbridge, which does cutting - edge health work in developing countries.he s particularly drawn to projects that wouldn t happen without his help. he quotes an observation by john gray, a contemporary british philosopher if you re merely spending your life doing things other people would have done had you never existed, what s the point he likes projects with high risk but high reward the sort of things politicians are afraid to support, things that fail 80 per cent of the time. if the upside is really great, i m fine with those odds, he says. the way you make progress is by taking calculated risks. not everything sweanor supports has paid off. some initiatives have been a complete and total waste of money, he acknowledges. but there have been others where you re just totally blown away by what they re able to accomplish. community improvement and social change, sweanor believes, often come down to somebody who has a bunch of energy and a really good idea. it really does change the world.

2015-01-04,North Korea denies role in Sony cyber attack as U.S. promises more sanctions,"north korea issued a furious statement sunday slamming the united states for imposing sanctions against government officials and the defense industry for a cyberattack on sony, the writes.here is the rest of the article it again denied any role in the breach of tens of thousands of confidential sony emails and business files.an unnamed spokesman of north korea s foreign ministry accused the you.s. of groundlessly stirring up hostility toward pyongyang and claimed that the new sanctions would not weaken the country s military.the spokesman was quoted by the country s korean central news agency as saying that the sanctions had proven counter - productive as shown by dprk s measures to further sharpen the treasured sword of songun, he said, referring to pyongyang s official military - first policy. dprk refers to the north s official name, the democratic people s republic of korea.the you.s. on friday sanctioned 10 north korean government officials and three organizations, including pyongyang s primary intelligence agency and state - run arms dealer, on what the white house described as an opening move in the respond toward the cyberattack on sony.the sanctions will have limited effect as north korea already is under tough you.s. sanctions over its nuclear program. president barack obama also warned pyongyang that the you.s. is considering whether to put north korea back on its list of state sponsors of terrorism, which could jeopardize aid to the country on a global scale.north korea has expressed fury over the sony comedy flick the interview, which depicts the fictional assassination of leader kim jong un. however, it continues to deny involvement in the cyberattack against sony, which later escalated to threats of terrorist attacks against movie theaters.sony initially decided to call off the film s release after movie theaters decided not to show the film. after obama criticized that decision, sony decided to release the film in limited theaters and online.and this article written earlier as well from the the united states says its new round of sanctions against north korea is just the opening salvo in its response to an unprecedented cyberattack on sony. yet there may be little else the you.s. can do to further isolate a country that already has few friends in the world.even the latest sanctions, handed down by president barack obama in an executive order, may not sting quite as badly as you.s. would have hoped. after all, north korea is already under a strict sanctions regime imposed by the you.s. over the north s nuclear program.the new round of sanctions unveiled friday hit three organizations closely tied to the north s defence apparatus, plus 10 individuals who work for those groups or for north korea s government directly. any assets they have in the you.s. will be frozen, and they ll be barred from using the you.s. financial system.but all three groups were already on the you.s. sanctions list, and officials couldn t say whether any of the 10 individuals even have assets in the you.s. to freeze.still, american officials portrayed the move as a swift and decisive response to north korean behaviour they said had gone far over the line. never before has the you.s. imposed sanctions on another nation in direct retaliation for a cyberattack on an american company. the order is not targeted at the people of north korea, but rather is aimed at the government of north korea and its activities that threaten the united states and others, obama wrote in a letter to house and senate leaders.north korea has denied involvement in the cyberattack, which led to the disclosure of tens of thousands of confidential sony emails and business files, then escalated to threats of terrorist attacks against movie theatres. many cybersecurity experts have said it s entirely possible that hackers or even sony insiders could be the culprits, not north korea, and questioned how the fbi can point the finger so conclusively.senior you.s. officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, repeated their assertion that north korea was responsible and said independent experts don t have access to the same classified information as the fbi.with this round of sanctions, the you.s. also put north korea on notice that payback need not be limited to those who perpetrated the attack.the 10 north koreans singled out for sanctions didn t necessarily have anything to do with the attack on sony, senior you.s. officials said. anyone who works for or helps north korea s government is now fair game, said the officials especially north korea s defence sector and spying operations.yet prominent lawmakers were already calling for an ever harsher stance. sen. bob corker, are - tenn., who is set to chair the senate foreign relations committee this year, said it was time to concede the you.s. policy on north korea isn t working.added house foreign affairs committee chairman ed royce, are - calif. we need to go further to sanction those financial institutions in asia and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous north korean regime. obama has said the you.s. is considering whether to put north korea back on its list of state sponsors of terrorism. beyond that, it s unclear what additional penalties the you.s. has in its arsenal. there is no appetite for a military intervention. the you.s. has said that some elements of its response may not be seen publicly, however.the sanctions target the country s primary intelligence agency, a state - owned arms dealer that exports missile and weapons technology, and the korea tangun trading corp., which supports defence research. the individuals sanctioned include north koreans representing the country s interests in iran, russia and syria.there was no immediate response from north korea. sony declined to comment.while denying any role in a cyberattack, north korea has expressed fury over the sony comedy flick the interview, which depicts a fictional assassination plot against north korean leader kim jong un. sony initially called off the film s release after movie theatres decided not to show the film. after obama criticized that decision, sony decided to release the film in a limited number of theatres and online.the white house called the sanctions the first aspect of our response to the sony attack, a declaration that raised fresh questions about who was behind a nearly 10 - hour shutdown of north korean websites last week. the shutdown prompted a blunt response from north korea s powerful national defence commission, which blamed the you.s. and hurled racial slurs at obama, calling him a reckless monkey in a tropical forest.

2015-01-04,Gormley: China's daddy complex,"it finally happened. after decades of irking western governments with its annoying habit of not being western, last week china did the one thing that the free world could never abide. more indicative of china s obdurate resolve than its protest crackdowns, more offensive to democratic sensibilities than its one - party rule, and more insulting to the united states than even its ability to be featured as a rising power on magazine covers, was this single violation china gmail.judging by some international reactions, the newest indignity foisted upon the chinese people is comparable in gravity only to china s earlier facebook and twitter bans, bans that we ll forevermore think of as mere shadows of the oppressive darkness to follow. good liberal democracies love to hate free speech restrictions.but while we re really good at sensing illegitimate political coercion, we re less adept at picking up on political manipulation, in other societies and in our own. we habitually overestimate the human ability to discern it, and habitually underestimate the harm that it can inflict.when judging china s government, for example, there s greater concern about the types of expression that are censored than about the type of expression that s encouraged the fawning type. there s to president xi jinping by a chinese pop star china produced an uncle xi; he dares to fight the tigers ! not afraid of heaven, not afraid of earth, dreamers all look to him ! there are the communist party s that broadcast political exhortations solidify our strong spiritual force to realize the chinese dream alongside effusive expressions of endearment toward chinese citizens dear, please come visit me often and opaque self - help tips do not lead life as if it were a cup of instant coffee and finally, there s the president s daddy xi. so while outside observers worry that xi is a strongman, the more pernicious issue and a related one is that he s a , inspiring not only fear in his citizens, but love. this development often gets laughed off as a strange curiosity of a coercive authoritarian regime, rather than understood as an essential tool of authoritarian systems that can negate the very need for coercion.we bring that strong bias against coercion home, satisfying ourselves with censorship laws and worrying less about propagandistic or lopsided political messaging. and after all, liberal democracies can t wholly outlaw manipulation that would mean outlawing a lot of political communication. but if politicians wholly manipulate citizens preferences, then democratic choice is moot.so all democracies grapple with the questions of what level of political manipulation is tolerable, and how to level the playing field so that political parties have an equal opportunity to manipulate voters strangely, i ve never heard a politician phrase it like this . we tend to boil the answers to these questions down to cash how much money parties can spend on campaigns, and where they can take money from.but even the existence of campaign spending limits is contested on the basis that they infringe on the right of powerful political and corporate interest groups to express themselves freely so freely that no one else s interests can be heard. and when these regulations are breached, it s hard to tell the depth of the violation.university of ottawa law professor errol mendes recently , for instance, that the conservative government may have committed democratic subterfuge, allegedly funnelling hundreds of millions of tax dollars into disguised but outrageously partisan ads since it came to power. t he harper government is clearly undermining the spirit of the rule of law critical to fair elections, mendes explains.he says, rightly, that underhanded political manipulation of this kind deserves a profound rebuke. but we only rebuke behavior we believe is harmful. we have free access to gmail, but little sensitivity to the restrictive power of political messaging, a problem that campaign spending regulations can t solve on their own anywhere."
2015-01-04,Agnes Cadieux: Stop whining and enjoy winter,"now that the holidays are over, it won t be long before the city plunges into the depths of the winter blahs. the gyms eventually thin out as drunken resolutions of a healthier me start to go by the wayside, and people give up on keeping their cars, boots, and travel bags salt - free. if we re not hearing it yet, we will soon be subject to that all - too - familiar grumbling about too much snow, scraping the windows, or more often, about how it is. well, this ottawa yet every year people stand huddled at the bus stops like groups of slighted blackbirds, or walk hastily from place to place, hunched over and wearing an expression that could melt a snowman. i say this because i ve been in that group of blackbirds, and am guilty of melting my share of snowmen. but winter doesn t have to be about treacherous road conditions or salt - stained pants; especially when ottawa and the surrounding valley have so much to offer during the winter months.there is an old saying . often times it is delivered tongue - in - cheek by those snow - loving humans you see out in the - 20 weather, smiling as they go about their business. typically it s met with a blunt stare and offensive muttering, but the truth is they re .just 20 minutes from downtown ottawa there are all sorts of activities to participate in alpine skiing at camp fortune and mont cascades, snowshoeing the greenbelt shirley s bay and stony swamp in the west, and green s creek and mer bleue in the east , and cross country ski trails anywhere from mooney s bay to kanata, to the gatineau hills. for those who are looking for a lower key activity, many hiking trails are still open throughout the region, and avid birders know that the season is an excellent time to take pictures of overwintering species, as well as grab a glimpse of some rarer ones not found any other time of the year.ottawa s various altitudes and terrains offer people a smorgasbord of activity options to chase away the winter blues, but cost is always a concern, especially after the holidays. the good thing is that all of these activities can be done on a budget. for outerwear, a waterproof outer layer and one to two warmer layers underneath are sufficient, as well as a comfortable pair of boots, toque, and mitts items many ottawans already have. many of the ski hills have two - for - one deals where you can buy a lift pass for less than 15 a person, and for those without skis, rentals are usually less than 30. hiking and birding are both free, and simply require a drive out to the trail parking lots. bird guides can be found at the local libraries, and binoculars for the casual birder can be picked up locally for less than 15. most cross country ski trails are also free, and those which require a fee cost less than your morning latte. for those who don t have equipment, there are various rental sites around town, which will rent equipment for as little as 25 for an entire weekend of skiing.many of us don t tolerate the cold very well, but if we have something to look forward to, it makes getting through the winter months more bearable even enjoyable. the options are vast and even within an activity there are various locations to enjoy the outdoors and take in ottawa s beautiful scenery. it s certainly a good way to beat the winter blahs, get fit, and spend time with family and friends. and you won t even feel bad for skipping the gym."

Marie chairlift,"staff at an area ski resort sang and told jokes to comfort scared children who sat on a broken chairlift many metres above in frigid temperatures saturday afternoon, one skier says.bryan alberton, 39, had brought his 11 - year - old son, tristan, to mont ste. marie, located about an hour north of ottawa, for a father - son ski trip to cap off the holidays. it was the first time they d been to the mountain, and was their first ski trip of the season, alberton says.they were on the vanier chairlift at around 12 30 p.m. when, without warning, they and about another 100 riders on the lift halted. all of a sudden it just stopped dead, alberton told the citizen from his home in cumberland saturday evening.at first, it seemed like the issue would be resolved in a few minutes, he said. as they hung 20 metres in the air with snow blowing in, alberton told his son to stay calm. he was really good about it, he said.but as time passed it became clear the issue was more serious, he said. after an hour, alberton began asking those around him what was being done to fix the lift and get everyone down.he said ski patrol started the rescue with those at the very top of the chairlift because temperatures there were even colder than the - 17 c without windchill he and his son were experiencing near the bottom.in addition to the ski patrol members rescuing riders, one resort staff member stood below each chair on the lift to communicate with those stranded above, alberton said. employees threw blankets and used ski straps to fling hand warmers up to riders.alberton said his iphone eventually stopped working due to the cold. meanwhile, skiers and boarders passed each other messages one chair at a time, like a giant game of telephone. my concern was for the other kids, alberton said. often, he said, parents will follow their children on the lift one or two chairs behind if there isn t enough space on one. one dad that was directly behind me, his kids were three or four chairs up, and he was real concerned for them, alberton said.and in front of he and his son s chair, a handful of other children around the age of 10 sat alone, alberton said. the kids were really scared, he said.but alberton said staff below talked to the children, trying to get them to sing or telling them jokes. that part of the experience seeing everyone trying to help one another was really cool, really neat to see, he says.after being stranded for nearly three hours, alberton and tristan were rescued using a cage and pulley system, he said.by that point, neither could feel their feet. it was tough to walk, he said.staff members brought alberton and his son directly to ski patrol, where they had access to everything from hot water packs to feet warmers. they had oxygen there for a couple of kids who were really cold. a couple of the kids there were real sick; they were shaking, alberton said.there was no report of injuries from the resort, although paramedics were reportedly on scene.by 4 p.m., the resort s twitter account had tweeted that all the chairlift riders had been rescued. it had earlier tweeted that it was removing people from the lift as a precaution. resort owner bob sudermann tweeted that the problem with the lift was related to a bearing, which he hoped would get fixed saturday. the resort later said the issue had been resolved.back home in cumberland, alberton said he and tristan were taking the night to sit by the fire, eat pizza and recover.asked whether they d be back at the mountain any time soon, alberton said, oh, yeah. stuff happens. eloop ottawacitizen.comtwitter "
2015-01-04,Tobi Nussbaum: What I learned knocking on Ottawa's doors,"the naked man opened his door partway to tell me that he was sorry he couldn t speak but that he had no clothes on. i immediately threw up my hands to indicate my full appreciation for his predicament and quickly moved to carry on to his neighbour s apartment. but hold on, come to think of it , he said, and proceeded to ask about the plans for the vacant lot across the street. i tried to balance a proper answer with a very brief one. brief was winning out. as we conversed, the door initially opened only a few inches was ever widening. i now had ample evidence that this gentleman was not at all lying to me.2014 brought me a whole host of new insights and experiences, thanks to the main activity i undertook throughout the year knocking on the doors of thousands upon thousands of fellow residents to ask about their thoughts, ideas and preoccupations when it came to improving their quality of life and building a better city.for example, i learned that my mr. rogers - like propensity toward slippers and sweaters when sitting around at home, while not exceptional, is certainly not shared by all. that was lesson number one.the second lesson was that ottawans are far more polite, respectful and open than many give us credit for. i could count the number of slammed doors on two hands. far more often, the interrupted, the harried, the angry or the disinterested would explain their state of mind in words, mostly polite ones with a hint or so i liked to believe of apology for not offering this perfect stranger at their door more of their time. in a vast majority of cases, the door would stay ajar, my initial questions answered by thoughtful ideas on what improvements could be made, changes affected and civic dreams imagined.the third lesson learned was that while many of my fellow residents know their neighbours on their streets and in their buildings, a surprising number do not. and density alone is not a solution. i was struck by the isolation of some living in situations where there is no lack of neighbours. apartment hallways could be forlorn and empty spaces, shuttling residents from locked and bolted door to the elevator. insufficient upkeep of properties and fear of crime can be important contributing factors. so too, however, is how we design our density.as we increasingly focus the growth of our city upwards instead of outwards, developers, architects and planners need to come up with more thoughtful ways to build our multi - unit dwellings to allow for more spontaneous and organic interactions among neighbours.open staircases for low - and mid - rise buildings not to be confused with hard to access, concrete fire escapes offer an opportunity for able - bodied residents to have easy and relaxed encounters, unlike the claustrophobic awkwardness of interminable elevator rides. amenity spaces on each floor whether a kitchen, dining room or lounge could provide a chance for residents to socialize in smaller, less anonymous ways.outside, thoughtfully - designed courtyards can provide protection and intimacy for playgrounds, and seating areas for book readers. similar objectives of small - scale, safe public spaces which encourage neighbourly interaction also need to be a part of design for streets with houses and stacked townhomes.why should socially connected residents interest municipal government because the last, and perhaps, most important, lesson i learned over my seven months of almost daily walking through my ward is that familiar neighbours are critical to building healthy communities. the most successful streets and buildings i encountered were the ones where people know each other; where milk is borrowed, plants are watered and kids looked after. the conversations at the doors of those blocks and floors turned to neighbourhood improvements, community meetings and a sense of ownership over the future. those were also the doors of areas where trust and happiness seemed to this walking visitor to be higher.credit for healthy social bonds rests with the people with the courage and energy to welcome their new neighbours, organize block parties and consciously nurture neighbourly ties. but good planning can abet or spike such efforts. we know that such bonds are less likely on streets with speeding traffic, poor public spaces and a lack of walkable destinations.as i enter 2015, my new year s resolutions include a commitment to remember the lessons of 2014 and work to ensure that city hall does more to support not frustrate the efforts of residents to build healthy neighbourhoods and positive social bonds among neighbours.and whether my list of resolutions also includes a more open mind to my domestic loungewear, i m not telling."
2015-01-04,U.S. government funds project to study how Americaâ€™s military families grieve,"the is reporting on a new study underway in the you.s. on bereavement and you.s. military families.here is the article with his wife and child close at hand, army maj. chad wriglesworth battled skin cancer for more than a year before dying at age 37. it was long and painful and awful, said aimee wriglesworth, who believes the cancer resulted from exposure to toxic fumes in iraq. yet the 28 - year - old widow from bristow, virginia, seized a chance to recount the ordeal and its aftermath to a researcher, hoping that input from her and her 6 - year - old daughter might be useful to other grieving military families. to be able to study what we felt and what we re going through maybe this will help people down the line, wriglesworth said.by the hundreds, other widows, widowers, parents, siblings and children are sharing accounts of their grief as part of the largest study ever of america s military families as they go through bereavement. about 2,000 people have participated over the past three years, and one - on - one interviews will continue through february.the federally funded project is being conducted by the center for the study of traumatic stress at the maryland - based uniformed services university of the health sciences. the study is open to families of the more than 19,000 service members from all branches of the military who have died on active duty since the terror attacks of sept. 11, 2001, regardless of whether the death resulted from combat, accident, illness, suicide or other causes. we ve been impressed by how many people who ve had this experience really want to let us know about it, said the leader of the study, dr. stephen cozza. they want to talk about what happened to provide information that will help them and people like them in the future. aimee wriglesworth is hopeful that the study will provide new insight on how best to support young families like hers. a lot of things that are helping us now come from vietnam, korea, world war ii, she said of existing assistance programs. but now it s a whole new world of military losses. studying us is really important. about half of the participants are providing saliva samples that will be used for genetic research, aimed at determining if certain genetic makeups correlate with the duration of the grieving process and the levels of stress and depression experienced as it unfolds. some previous research has suggested that a certain gene variation is associated with greater risk of complicated grief, especially in women.cozza said a final report isn t expected until 2017, and he is encouraging more survivors to sign up for interviews before the cutoff date in late february. our interest is understanding what these families need, he said. recognizing the need will allow us to make better policy recommendations as to what sort of services would be appropriate for them. the questionnaires and face - to - face interviews are being handled by eight field researchers based in regions spanning the country.jill harrington, the senior field researcher, said the team members are experienced in dealing with grief and well - versed in military culture. for the families of the fallen, whoever they talk to, they want to be able to trust, harrington said. we have a highly trained group of folks who know how to listen and how to be patient. while bereaved military families share much in common with other grieving families, there are distinctive aspects to many military deaths. whether in combat, or by accident or suicide, they often occur suddenly, and many of the deceased are in their 20s or 30s. these are young families a lot of single parents raising kids alone, said harrington. when someone dies young, there s a loss of the future. how do you live with that loss in your life some insight on that question will be provided by the roughly 100 children, ages 6 to 18, who are participating in the study. most are the sons or daughters of deceased service members; a few are younger siblings. many of these children, when their parent died, were very young and didn t know them well, said cozza. according to preliminary findings, he said, a factor helping them weather the loss was having pride in their departed parent s military service.the web site for the study encourages bereaved parents to let their children participate, while acknowledging that the one - on - one interviews, lasting 90 minutes to three hours, cover sensitive matters. the field researchers are trained to recognize when a child is upset and will periodically ask your child if he she is okay to continue, the web site says. if your child becomes upset, he she can decide to stop the interview at any time. among the children taking part is aimee wriglesworth s daughter, savannah, who was 5 when her father died at home on november 20, 2013. family photos from the preceding days show savannah cuddling up with him as he lay stricken in bed.chad wriglesworth initially joined the air force and was deployed to iraq in 2008. he transferred to the army in 2009, and was deployed to afghanistan in 2011.according to his wife, he began reporting lumps on various parts of his body starting in 2011 and was diagnosed in 2012 with stage 4 melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. the military, without being more specific, ruled that the major s death occurred in the line of duty; his wife believes the cancer was caused by his exposure to toxic fumes from open - air burn pits in iraq that were used to destroy waste at you.s. bases.another study participant is ryan manion borek, whose brother, marine lt. travis manion, was killed in combat in iraq in 2007. borek now heads a foundation named after her brother, which seeks to assist veterans, as well as families of fallen service members.borek expressed hope that the study s findings will reflect the wide range of ways in which survivors respond to the deaths of their loved ones. we don t all fit into the same box, she said. that s the beauty of doing a study like this we can begin to understand all the different ways people are dealing with their loss. a video produced by the research team conveys the breadth of the study, featuring brief interviews with some of the survivors who decided to participate.they include a marine corps officer, lisa doring, whose marine husband died in a helicopter crash near their base in iraq; a mother whose only son, an army private, was killed by friendly fire in afghanistan; and a couple whose son, serving in the coast guard, committed suicide after what they described as sustained bullying and harassment.of all the active - duty deaths in the period being studied, about 13 percent were suicides. accidents accounted for 35 percent, combat 30 percent, illness 15 percent and homicide 3 percent, according to cozza.one of the major partners for the study is the arlington, virginia - based support group known as taps the tragedy assistance program for survivors. it was founded in 1994 by bonnie carroll two years after her husband, a brigadier general, died in an army plane crash.carroll said she was heartened that the study encompassed all types of deaths, even including service members responsible for murder - suicides. regardless of how the person died, at some point in their life they stepped forward to raise their right hand and say i will protect this nation,' carroll said."

2015-01-04,Local retailers felt a boost this holiday shopping season,"ottawa s independent retailers are feeling pretty good about business coming out of the holiday season, despite industry experts modest predictions for the final numbers.bridget remai, co - owner of flock and workshop boutiques, said she thought customers might have decided to speak with their money in support of local shops. we felt really embraced by the community this year, she said. her wellington west shop specializing in canadian - made products was part of two events in october and november to boost local shopping.retail industry expert doug stephens said holiday shopping certainly didn t break any records this year and that black friday and cyber monday retail sales were relatively underwhelming. he said retail shopping was expected to grow two to three per cent this holiday season, which is consistent with the deloitte 2014 holiday retail outlook forecast of growth between two and 2.5 per cent.ted mallett, vice - president and chief economist at the canadian federation of independent business, said retailers optimism was slightly dampened heading into the holiday season due to dropping oil prices.it was an important year for retailers because they are facing growing competition from american companies entering the canadian market, stephens said, and a longer holiday shopping season due to pre - black friday sales.he said small retailers can t compete with the big chains on lower prices but they offer a better shopping experience, and they should unashamedly charge a premium for that better experience. remai said she thought people came to her store for better service, fewer crowds and better music. i haven t entered a mall in six years now and my life is so much better for it, she said.industry experts are also predicting that online shopping will continue to rise 10 to 15 per cent per year because consumers want convenience and more variety.although her shop still does 99 per cent of its sales in - store, remai said she and her business partner added online shopping to their website in october after customers had been requesting it for a long time.but kim ferguson, co - owner of kaleidoscope kids books, said that her shop has a competitive advantage over giants like amazon because shoppers can get their hands on a book before they buy it. for picture books and board books, you want to see them before you get them, she said. kaleidoscope also has online ordering.ferguson said street presence and foot traffic are still a very important part of her business. the new shops at lansdowne brought more foot traffic and slightly better sales than last year into her bank street shop, she said."
2015-01-04,Afghanistan to go the way of Iraq?,"you.s. sen. john mccain is worried that the pullout of most you.s. troops from afghanistan that could spawn a repeat of iraq s violent decline, writes my defense news colleague . no one should mistake the administration s declared end of combat operations in afghanistan with an end of our mission there, mccain, the senate armed services committee chairman said in a recent statement. the truth is, this work remains unfinished. indeed, steady reports of taliban offensives are a painful reminder of that fact. mccain wants the you.s. government to replace its calendar - driven drawdown of you.s. forces, saying it should replace it with a plan based on conditions on the ground, noted in his article. if this is not done, and if the administration insists on pulling all us forces out of the country for political reasons, afghanistan will deteriorate just as iraq has since 2011, mccain said. that would not just be a tragedy for the afghan people; it would put the american people in far greater danger. meanwhile the taliban have their own view. taliban fighters in afghanistan declared the defeat of the you.s. and its allies, a day after the coalition officially ended its combat mission, the reported.a taliban statement said the us - led force had rolled up its flag without having achieved anything, the added.nato s international security assistance force isaf combat mission officially ended on january 1. but thousands of nato soldiers are still in the country on a training and support mission."
2015-01-04,Letter: Selective Conservative thrift,"re , december 30.john baird s claim that the federal government just doesn t have the money for a new science museum is both pathetic and laughable.they somehow found more than 100 million to advertise their so - called economic action plan , and about 30 to 40 million to commemorate the war of 1812, along with other major ad campaigns that were light on content and heavy on politics. their obsession with gimmicky tax cuts, many benefitting mainly the rich and the corporate sector, has also limited their room to manoeuvre.the failure to build a new national science museum on lebreton flats will be a lasting, historic mistake, and a huge lost opportunity in a city running out of large, prime, central locations for major institutions."
2015-01-05,Q&amp;A: Canadian Veterans' Advocacy president Michael Blais,"canadian veterans advocacy president has been one of the more outspoken and high profile critics of the conservative government s handling of veterans issues. his group is part of the four - member coalition of canadians for veterans.2014 has been a busy and fractious year on the veterans front. it saw the number of suicides among serving soldiers at least 161 among surpass the number of soldiers 158 who were killed in the afghan conflict. not included in official statistics are an unknown number of recently released soldiers who have taken their own lives.politically, veterans affairs minister julian fantino continues to face a barrage of criticism from veterans. a critical auditor general s report in november agreed with them on key points. also in november, veterans groups publicly critical of the conservative government blais s among them were excluded from a veterans affairs - sponsored stakeholders meeting in quebec city shortly after prime minister stephen harper appointed former chief of defence staff walter natynczyk to be fantino s deputy minister a move widely seen as a mix of damage control and bridge building.blais sees the 2015 election year as a potentially crucial one. he spoke to the citizen s about a frenetic and 2014 and plans for the battle ahead.a negative. mr. harper has not responded. we ve never had any substantial responses to any letters either from the minister or prime minister. when there s a response, it s always the same talking points. they never answer a question.a because we believe he is the de facto minister of veterans affairs. i watch minister fantino in the house reading from these talking points written for him. fantino is the puppet.a i don t know. at first i was excited but then as an advocacy group we were excluded from a stakeholders meeting. i find myself facing a contradiction. will there be dialogue or will he be a minion of stephen harper. is it just another figurehead i hope not.a we have an agenda and we are kicking off a very aggressive campaign in the new year when parliament resumes.a it s pre - election time. we have been in patrolling mode for the past year and now its time to go into an advance and contact mode. we are going to be aggressive in responding to the government s promised the review of the new veterans charter if it doesn t meet our expectations of equality, which i doubt it will. during budget time we will be organizing a large rally, probably on the saturday before and another on budget day with other disenfranchised groups who are sharing the same burden of a nation that has lost its compassion and understanding.a there will be all kinds of freebies and giveaways, but the disenfranchised will not find justice in this budget.a late february, early march. my gut feeling is that the prime minister will want an election prior to duffygate trial of former senator mike duffy blowing up. so it s important for us to be proactive. we will bring veterans issues back to the national consciousness in the new year despite the fact the government wants it to go away. well, we re not going to let it go away.a sure. we have been talking about the reality of engaging during the election campaign in a non - partisan manner. if the other parties were as averse to veterans as the harper government, we would take them on, too. the liberal program hasn t been formally released, but i have talked to mr. trudeau and his senior advisers and i m confident they will meet the obligation. the ndp has a good plan. with the conservatives there is nothing good we can report. every headline has been a headline without substance 200 million turns out to be 200 million over 50 years.in the interim, people are dying and the cycle of despair is destroying families.a yes. how many veterans have committed suicide since afghanistan started guys who have got out of the military for one or two years and commit suicide we ve got to help these boys, but how do we do it when we don t know who they are we need to implement a research program through veterans affairs."
2015-01-05,Editorial: A new start with veterans,"in all the nostalgia about sir john a. macdonald this week, it will no doubt be mentioned that the country s first prime minister liked to refer to himself as a cabinet - maker. the charming thing about that joke is that it portrays the prime minister s job as being one of craft and diligence, of working at something until it is good, and then working at it some more to make it better. when something goes wrong, a cabinet - maker doesn t stand up and argue to his last breath that it s perfectly good as it is. a cabinet - maker simply fixes it.so it is to prime minister stephen harper s credit that he finally, and very quietly, patched up the most glaring problem with his own cabinet, and shuffled julian fantino away from veterans affairs, although it should have been done long ago. a more confident craftsman might have taken fantino out of cabinet altogether, rather than putting him back into the associate position in defence.after all, fantino s efforts to defend the government s f - 35 program did not cover him, or the government, in glory. when he was international development minister, fantino s office was involved in posting blatantly partisan material to a government website. in every one of his portfolios, he has had trouble articulating the government s plans and communicating with stakeholders.this was particularly damaging in the veterans affairs file, where the stakeholders are vets and their families. the most important job for a veterans affairs minister is to listen, and fantino s listening was selective at best. while he may have genuinely wanted to help veterans in general, his tendency to argue with or ignore them and their families in personal confrontations undermined the government s relationship with vets and eroded whatever trust they had left. while he may have useful interpersonal skills in less public contexts, his question period performances simply make the government look foolish and defensive. he was out of the country when the auditor general delivered a critical report on mental - health services for veterans.it will be a surprise if fantino performs any better as associate minister of defence this time around. but at least the government now has the chance to make a fresh start with the country s veterans.erin o toole served in the canadian forces himself before practising law, and already has a strong relationship with veterans organizations. he seems to have a more approachable style of communicating. this makes for an excellent start to a new relationship, but that relationship could sour just as quickly if the government maintains its defensive posture toward veterans. clearly, there are real problems with service delivery, and all the talking points in the world will not solve those problems.and the job is not going to get any easier. as the auditor general pointed out, the number of veterans with identified mental health conditions is expected to continue to increase as those with service in afghanistan return to civilian life, and as awareness and recognition of mental health conditions increase. the bad relationship with veterans is bad for the conservative brand heading into an election. more importantly, this dishonourable treatment of veterans, making them wait and jump through hoops for the benefits to which they re entitled, is bad for the country."

2015-01-05,Alex Roberts: The story of 2014 in numbers,"2014 was a fairly typical year in our big data, information - driven world, with the usual deluge of facts and figures, studies, rankings, and poll results. much of the data served only as statistical background noise, largely ignored by the media and the public, yet providing valuable information to the decision - making bodies in government, and industry. however, some of the numbers as brutally compressed as they often are helped to shape our attitudes and opinions, along with offering the potential to change the debate.with that in mind, let s crunch a few of the more interesting, eye - popping and thought - provoking numbers that crossed my desk in 2014.some of the most statistically significant numbers from 2014 involved climate change data, especially those dealing with temperatures and co2 levels. in that regard the latest figures january - october were not good news for climate - change deniers, given that global temperatures were on track to make 2014 . in fact, non - instrumentation climate data tree rings readings, coral reef samples, etc. show that the earth has likely not been this warm in at least four millennia, with greenhouse - gas readings approaching their highest levels in more than 20,000 years.sadly, canada was 40 countries in terms of our climate change record in 2014, by germanwatch, a sustainable development advocacy group. the performance index they used included a variety of gauges including emissions, renewable energy investments and climate policies.with a federal election scheduled for october 2015, pollsters had a field day in 2014, churning out nearly 50 pre - election polls. however, based on an analysis , there was surprisingly little change in the party standings. the conservatives were unchanged from 2013 at 30 per cent support. the liberals averaged 3.59 per cent support in 2014, up 3.1 points over their average in 2013. the ndp fell 2.3 points to an average in 2014 of 22.4 per cent.overall approval ratings had justin trudeau well ahead of harper at 44.5 per cent vs 32.6 per cent, with thomas mulcair a strong second with a 42.3 per cent approval.many of last year s most interesting numbers concerned various aspects of crime. in fact according to the latest statscan data, canada is safer than at any time in the past 40 years, with the 1.44 per 100,000 is at its lowest level since 1966. as well, most gun - related homicides were committed with handguns, a trend that has held for the past last 20 years. however, even the rate of handgun - related homicides since 1998.by the fourth quarter, the canadian economy was picking up speed with the gdp growing at an annualized 2.8 per cent rate suggesting that the effects of the 2008 - 2009 recession are truly on the wane. however, a closer look at the standard gauge of economic performance real economic growth per capita and we find that the steady hand of the conservatives over the past nine years has resulted in the slowest economic growth for any government since the 1930s. that s one fact you probably won t see in any of the government s advertisements.on the bright side, the national unemployment rate had dropped to 6.6 per cent by november, at or near its lowest levels since 2006. however, the participation rate the proportion of the population aged 15 and over in the work force stayed at 66 per cent the lowest level since 2002, and suggesting that the lower unemployment rate was at least in part the result of fewer people looking for jobs.among the year s mushiest of the year s statistics besides statscan s miscalculation of canada s job numbers for july were the government s deficit numbers. in fact, the latest figures show that the conservatives are still running large monthly deficits 3,200,000,000 in october alone, due in part to new election - inspired tax credits, and the free - fall in oil prices. these factors certainly put the government s obsession with balancing the budget in time for the 2015 election in doubt. and when you figure the conservatives have yet to hit single deficit forecast since they were elected in 2006, one is certainly reminded of that old john kenneth galbraith bromide, which went the only function of economic is to make astrology look respectable. in terms of the stock markets, canadian investors endured a tumultuous year, with the toronto s tsx composite index hitting a record high of 15,685 in september, only to plummet by nearly 2,000 points under the weight of the collapse in oil prices. a december rally resulted in a relatively modest 7 per cent gain on the year. of course, you might have bought shares which increased a nifty 484 per cent during the year, to lead all stocks on the tsx.in closing, my pick for the stat of the year goes to china s gdp, which according to the latest imf figures will hit 17.6 trillion in 2014 compared with 17.4 trillion for the you.s. thus, for the first time since the 1880s, the you.s. economy is not the largest on the planet. go figure !

2015-01-05,Ottawa Little Theatre needs a big renovation,"ottawa little theatre s renew the building campaign is gaining traction, with more than 300,000 raised toward its five - year goal of 975,000. the money is earmarked for much - needed renovations of the brick and metal - clad building that s anchored the northwest corner of king edward avenue and besserer street since 1972.olt s executive director lynn mcguigan says an engineer s report two years ago deemed the building structurally stable, but if we don t do this work, it won t stay that way. the campaign comprises four acts. the first, including replacement of aging lighting and sound equipment, is completed. the next two window, cladding and roof repairs are critical the spring melt, for example, inevitably brings ceiling leaks in the lobby. acts two and three will include further greening of the building. the closing act will see the tired auditorium seats replaced and the besserer street entrance jazzed up and made more accessible for disabled theatre - goers.founded in 1913 under its original name of the ottawa drama league and said to be the oldest on - going community theatre in north america, olt is appealing to everyone from patrons to the ontario trillium foundation for cash. the campaign includes the 5 club with members donating 5 a month for five years; if all subscribers and volunteers joined, the building renewal campaign, which ends in 2018, would reach its goal.doug harvey - smith is among the donors. an olt subscriber for over two decades, he s donated 1,000. i just love the theatre. i ve been associated with it so long it s like an old friend, he says.his preference runs to comedies this old bugger needs cheering up, he jokes . upcoming productions including samuel taylor s romantic comedy sabrina fair in february followed by douglas bowie s comedy drama goodbye, piccadilly in march should put a smile on his face.john marc keyes is also a donor as well as president of olt s board and chair of the fundraising committee. he s set a sterling example with his own gift of 10,000. i made it because i m committed to the theatre and it s important to show leadership on these things, to put your money where your mouth is. keyes has also acted in several olt shows, most recently playing boolie the son of miss daisy in the 2014 production of alfred uhry s driving miss daisy.for all those involved in mounting a play, he s says it s a sandbox of experiences outside one s day - to - day life or job.by bringing together audiences, performers and others for a shared experience, olt also helps build a sense of solidarity in the community. and very often our plays prompt people to think about things; the conversation continues afterward. during a chunk of the 20th century, audiences talking about shows included the cream of ottawa society. through the 1930s, 40s and beyond when there was little competition for theatre audiences, olt was a cultural mecca frequented by the diplomatic corps and others, with black ties and even opera capes not unknown as audience attire.robertson davies, later a literary star, was a multiple winner at olt s national one - act playwriting competition, and now - famous performers like dan aykroyd and rich little got their starts on the olt stage.olt was housed in the eastern methodist church at the same address as its present home from 1928 until the building was destroyed by fire in 1970. the current theatre opened two years later and was paid for entirely within five years with no government grants or subsidies.thanks to an explosion of entertainment choices as well as an aging demographic less inclined to venture out for an evening s entertainment, olt has in recent years been hit by the same declining subscription rates that have nibbled away at theatres across north america. however, a new focus on single - ticket sales combined with vigorous marketing to various age groups has helped pull olt back from the brink of potential disaster, and the theatre now has a surplus of 410,000 on an annual operating budget of 1.2 million. it averages 70 per cent attendance, roughly that of nac english theatre and the great canadian theatre company.the theatre has also revitalized its programming to focus more on contemporary productions including clybourne park, bruce norris pulitzer - winning 2010 satirical comedy about race relations. it opens january 13 and comes with warnings of mature language and content.with everything from programming to the theatre itself in the process of refreshment, mcguigan is optimistic about olt s future. but we do recognize we re dealing with a different mix in our audience and a different way of buying tickets.

2015-01-05,Letter: Canada's role in the world,"re , december 27.it seems like the conservative government is being duplicitous in its foreign policy with regard to the sale of arms. prime minister stephen harper is proud of how much he is helping the people in the ukraine stand up to russian supported invaders and how our airforce is fighting isil. both of these insurgents are using arms supplied by russia and likely china. however, harper will not sign the arms trade treaty att that is designed to regulate the global flow of weapons and ammunition and keep them away from dictators and criminals. israel with a huge per capita spending on arms and the united states with a powerful gun lobby have both signed the att. meanwhile canada is hiding behind some concerns that this treaty affects lawful and responsible firearms owners. more likely, their real concern is that it will affect canadian arms manufacturers. the government will allow general dynamics to sell 10 billion worth of armoured military vehicles to saudi arabia who used similar canadian - made armoured vehicles to help neighbouring bahrain crack down on demonstrations during the arab spring in 2011. the conservatives also actively promote the sale of arms to countries in south america and asia.it seems like a no brainer that the att, while it would not stop illegal smuggling of weapons, would limit the availability of arms. russia, china, syria and north korea and saudi arabia and canada have not signed the att. i m concerned that we are going to be judged by the company we keep."

2015-01-05,Letter: Responses to Matthew Fisher,"re , december 30.columnist matthew fisher would have us believe that electing the liberals in 2015 would radically change our military strategies, from warring to kumbaya. he assumes that there are no pitfalls from our current warring mode that should warrant rethinking. he says that previous liberal governments have sent our military to war well of course they have, including the second world war, ironically citing the chr tien government who sat out the invasion of iraq.i doubt very much that a liberal government would do anything differently, that foreign policies would drastically change, because that s the way canada has always been, rational come to the aid where war is necessary, and peacekeeping where it isn t. the lone trudeau denouncement of war was in the preamble as to whether or not to bomb isil, and, although i was onside with prime minister stephen harper s decision, i and perhaps many others may regret this combat that seems endless, like the war in afghanistan where more than 2,000 canadians were injured or killed and so many others with post traumatic stress disorder.if there is to be any change, i think it would be peacekeeping as our default mode, and war if we were absolutely certain that it was necessary.in his column, matthew fisher chronicles a litany of international hot spots seemingly spinning out of control. his message to canadians seems clear to fight oppression and terrorism we need to stay the militaristic course adopted first by the chr tien and martin governments in afghanistan and now more broadly across the region by the current conservative government.however, what fisher fails to point out is that the west s combative middle eastern strategy in afghanistan, iraq, libya, syria and elsewhere has been an utter failure in stemming the tide of radical islam. in fact there are convincing arguments that it has had the exact opposite effect by contributing to destabilization across the region and fanning the flames of terrorism.coincidentally in the same issue of the citizen, ronald crelinsten s opinion piece tackling the challenge of terrorism in 2015, december 30 points out that the greatest challenge for 2015 is for governments to combine criminal justice and military policies with a comprehensive smart approach both at home and abroad.although fisher denigrates justin trudeau for apparently dreaming of a gentler canada in a gentler era, trudeau has been consistent since the boston marathon bombing stating that winning the war against terrorists is contingent on understanding and tackling root causes. recently, nato s top general philip breedlove agreed saying until we have addressed the root causes of these kinds of issues, we can expect to have to continue to deal with these kind of issues. fisher is however correct to point out that canadians must decide in 2015 whether we want to continue with a government that seems to single - mindedly promote more of the same militarism in the hope that it won t generate more of the same results or to become a leader in developing a more comprehensive, smarter approach to combat terrorism at home and abroad."

2015-01-05,Retirements leave RCAF young but inexperienced,"retirements have left canada s air force young but inexperienced, a situation that will lead to quick promotions in the future for those who remain, according to documents obtained by the citizen.the royal canadian air force outlined its situation in its 2014 - 2015 business plan, noting that almost 49 per cent of its regular force has less than 10 years of service. we have recently seen the retirement of an aging, but very experienced cohort and now remain a force made up of a larger population of young, relatively inexperienced personnel, stated the business plan, signed off by rcaf commander lt. - gen. yvan blondin.the plan was obtained by the citizen.rcaf personnel who remain will experience rapid growth and rapid promotion rates, the document noted.it also warned that during the next three to five years the rcaf will face the challenge of providing staff to fill an additional 300 to 500 positions. those positions would be to staff a newly created air expeditionary unit, the chinook helicopter unit at petawawa, and a new squadron expected to be created to operate unmanned aerial vehicles, better known as drones.rcaf officers have previously suggested that such personnel would be transferred from other units in the air force.some positions for the expeditionary unit, designed to be quickly deployed on international missions, could be filled by staff from the army and navy, according to the business plan. to find staff to operate the drones, the rcaf will be required to carefully and cautiously look to current capabilities to fill the gaps, it added.attrition rates for the rcaf are at 4.4 per cent, below the canadian forces average of 4.9 per cent, the plan noted.but the rcaf is also having problems filling jobs, including those of pilots. the risk of the rcaf being unable to fill established positions at each rank for each rcaf occupation is assessed as high, the business plan stated.department of national defence spokesman dan lebouthillier noted that the canadian forces is one of the most highly trained and respected militaries in the world. with the current royal canadian air force personnel, the organization remains ready and able to surmount the challenges of the future, he stated in an email. we remain committed to developmental programs and learning training activities to ensure our members continue to have the right toolkit to serve canadians proudly and effectively, he stated. the rcaf continues to be exceptionally agile and effective, having supported multiple missions throughout the year, including op reassurance, op impact, strategic airlift support and our commitment to norad which includes our annual escort of santa claus. the citizen recently reported that the canadian forces is short hundreds of full - time members and thousands of reservists, due in part to an unexpected spike in the number of personnel hanging up their uniforms and to difficulties attracting and training new recruits.the shortfall is expected to last years thanks to recent cuts to military recruitment and training brought in by the conservative government.that shortfall, outlined in a department of national defence report recently tabled in the house of commons, reached nearly 900 regular force members and 4,500 part - time reservists at the end of march 2014.the report doesn t provide any explanation for why military personnel were leaving at an unexpected rate. it does note that given recruiting and training capacity, it will take some years to recover from the current shortfall. it adds that the military will try to limit voluntary attrition and address the shortfall as soon as practical. maintaining the personnel capabilities of a large organization such as the canadian armed forces requires a constant balance of recruiting new members and retaining trained personnel, said dnd spokesman zoltan csepregi. the caf experiences changes in the rate of attrition, or departures, from one year to the next, he added. caf strength will be closely monitored to ensure that the caf meets its domestic and international defence commitments as assigned by the government of canada.

2015-01-05,"Fantino returns to DND, a previously troubled posting","conservative mp julian fantino is headed back to the department of national defence in what amounts to a demotion for the gaffe - plagued member of parliament.fantino was dropped from his position as minister of veterans affairs after alienating many in the veterans community with a series of high - profile public relations misfires. he will now assume the role of associate minister of defence, a job he held between may 2011 and july 2012.at that time fantino had been brought in to improve defence procurement and oversee the purchase of the controversial f - 35 stealth fighter.during his tenure at the dnd, fantino was steadfast in his support for the multi - billion - dollar plane. he noted that he personally had examined all facets of the aircraft and concluded that it was the best plane for canada. we will purchase the f - 35, he said on november 8, 2011, in fort worth, texas, home of lockheed martin s f - 35 assembly line. we re on record. we re part of the crusade. we re not backing down. fantino often accused those who questioned the deal of trying to undermine the country, the military and canada s aerospace industry. i can guarantee that the plan is on track, he said of the f - 35.but five months later fantino was in full retreat. we have not as yet discounted the possibility, of course, of backing out of any of the program, he said in march 2012.the conservative government eventually put the f - 35 purchase on hold after auditor general michael ferguson found that department of national defence officials withheld key information from parliament about the fighter jet, under - estimated costs, and didn t follow proper procurement rules.alan williams, a former top procurement official at dnd and public works, claims fantino was a disaster as associate defence minister. he knew nothing about the f - 35, explained williams, who retired in 2005 but has been critical of how the conservatives handled the f - 35 program. certainly he seems to be unable to grasp the business that he is there to be accountable for. williams noted that fantino appears to be unable to go beyond the information in his pre - approved government talking points.he also pointed out that fantino made little headway on improving procurement while at dnd. throughout the conservative tenure, including his, procurement times have gotten worse, williams noted.the dnd produced a report in 2011 that found delays in the purchasing of military equipment reached record levels under the conservative government.it now takes, on average, 199 months more than 16 years from start to finish for military acquisitions, the examination of 55 equipment projects found. the report was written four years ago, but there has been little improvement in the meantime, say dnd sources.fantino issued a statement monday where he talked about being keen to assume his position at the dnd. i am humbled to take on this new responsibility as canada s associate minister of national defense sic where i pledge to work hard to assure the safekeeping of our land, people and interests at home and around the world, he said. in my oath, i pledge to forcefully defend canada s sovereignty and national security, and continue to stand with our men and women in uniform who uphold and protect those sacred values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law.

2015-01-05,Skof: Ottawa needs more police officers,"the paralysis of ottawa s civic and police service leadership has now reached a critical stage. the police services board s hiring freeze, now into its sixth year, has resulted in increasing service vulnerabilities that have been papered over by successive police chiefs and board chairs. against a backdrop of significant population growth, staffing requirements determined in 2001 fail to meet today s demands for service. the urgent need to shift resources to the guns and gangs g g unit in the wake of surging gun violence across the city has finally exposed the folly of years of budget - politics.let me be clear that the increased resources to the g g unit are warranted the women and men who pursue these increasingly reckless criminals are dedicated professionals. the problem with these resource shifts is that the police chief continues to raid the resources of one area of the service to shore up holes in another. this approach to police staffing may satisfy an occasional, unpredicted need, but as a systemic response to increasing demands within a police service, the practice becomes a recipe for disaster. the chief s shift in resources today leaves ottawa s streets with the lowest number of patrol officers since the amalgamation of the regional police services in the mid - 1990s.the current staffing model for the patrol division was adopted by the board in 2001. since then, ottawa s population has increased by approximately 155,000. to put this in perspective, the growth in ottawa s population is comparable to relocating the residents of kingston to ottawa. this population increase can be expressed another way since 2001, the city has added approximately 80,000 new housing units, each contributing to the annual tax revenue for the city. much of our population growth has occurred outside the greenbelt, significantly expanding the geographic demands on policing services. patrol cars have further to travel to answer calls for assistance, for example. these factors have not been lost on the city, as it has expanded the fire service by adding three new stations and nearly a hundred full - time fire fighters.as public service providers, municipal governments typically grow in some proportion to the population. this is particularly true with core essential services which, by their very nature, require a swift response to calls for assistance. notwithstanding the massive expansion to the population tax base, the police chief, board chair and mayor remain content with a staffing model created in 2001 and based on ottawa s population at that time. this is irresponsible.critics may suggest this argument is self - serving, and that it would be expected from the police association s president. however, the understaffing practices in ottawa have also been acknowledged by conservative think - tank the fraser institute, in the context of a recent study of national staffing practices.in that study, the fraser institute observed that ottawa s staffing level is at 141 officers per 100,000 people, but determined that it should be at 162 officers per 100,000. the institute s methodology accounts for the less severe types of crime in ottawa. for example, toronto has 179 officers per 100,000 people, but the report recommends 182 officers per 100,000. applying the fraser institute s staffing model, the ottawa police service is approximately 189 officers short. an expected response will be that ottawa s staffing levels are supplemented by the presence of the rcmp. this is not helpful to their propping up of the status quo, since the rcmp s federal mandate in ottawa actually adds to the workload of ottawa s police officers.the problem gets much worse. the patrol division s actual number of boots on the ground is further eroded by temporary transfers of officers to other sections of the workplace. the chief will say there s an adequate number of people allocated to the patrol division, but there s a growing number of people on paper who haven t seen the streets in some time. let s be perfectly clear, these officers are doing important, valued police work, but are taken off the street to fill holes in other parts of the service.the 2001 staffing model requires a minimum of 42 police officers at the start of each shift shifts are designed to overlap to cover high - volume periods . the ottawa police association has been able to determine that the service now regularly falls below and sometimes far below the minimum shift starting level of 42 officers.ottawa s civic leaders the mayor, council and the police services board have championed budget freezes and staffing reductions for some time. many ottawa residents will recall the standoff between chief thomas flanagan and council in the early 1990s, when his police budget was considered excessive. police budgets are meant to be insulated from the vagaries of municipal politics. the ontario anticipates the possibility of tensions between political interests and the chief s duty to ensure a police service is adequately staffed. when these two interests collide, the requires that such budget disputes be resolved by a panel of independent commissioners appointed by the province.i never expected the ottawa police association and the fraser institute would share the view that there is an inadequate staffing level for the ottawa police service. perhaps our discussion of proper staffing levels should begin with everyone agreeing that it is not 2001, and that it s time to police for our city s needs in 2015."

2015-01-05,Staying safe during this weekâ€™s deep freeze,"ottawa public health is urging citizens to be vigilant during this week s frigid temperatures, the coldest the capital has seen since winter began.the city has issuedfrostbite advisory, which will remain in effect throughout the week. the department warns that the vulnerable, including the elderly, homeless, young children and outdoor workers, should take extra care to protect themselves against frostbite and hypothermia.environment canada expected the temperature to dip to - 20 monday night with a wind chill of - 25. the remainder of the week shows a similar arctic trend with the overnight temperature wednesday forecast to plunge to - 30. the big chill will stay around until next week when temperatures return to daytime highs of between - 7 and - 11.in this cold weather exposed skin will start to show signs of freezing in 15 minutes, says martha robinson, extreme weather lead at ottawa public health. it s what robinson calls the four ps. so it s pink skin or red skin, pain, prickly feeling like it s numb, and patches white patches, says robinson, who encourages people to check forecasts before leaving the house and to dress in layers. if you are covered properly, then no problem, but if you re not dressed properly you are going to start to feel the effects. the city is working with the salvation army, red cross and emergency shelter services like the ottawa mission to raise awareness, identify people in need of assistance and ensure emergency shelter space is available.shirley roy of the ottawa mission says in extreme weather hot or cold a shelter team scans the neighbourhood every half - hour for the vulnerable.to make sure that anyone with any mental health or addiction issues is not showing any signs of frostbite, and that they are going inside regularly, says roy, who says the shelter is accepting donations of gently used coats and boots and new socks, underwear and long johns.the frostbite advisory is also a cue for the salvation army s outreach van to drive around the city 24 hours a day with hot drinks, sleeping bags and blankets. they are looking for people on the street who may not be feeling the cold or be dressed properly, says robinson. so those people are out there, the volunteers and the salvation army truck s out looking for people and trying to encourage them to come into a shelter. as for pets owners, the ottawa humane society warns that cats and dogs left outside too long risk frostbite and even death without shelter from extreme weather.dogs that live outside are required by law to have an insulated doghouse built from weatherproof material, facing away from prevailing winds and elevated from the ground with a door flap and bedding. other precautions include wiping dog s paws of road salt after returning from walks, watching that outdoor water bowls don t freeze and avoiding leaving your pet in a cold car for long periods. the society also warns drivers to watch out for animals that may have crawled under your car to keep warm.cars, too, have a tough time in the cold. amy orfanakos of the canadian automobile association says cars are affected when the air reaches the - 20 mark without a wind chill. to avoid being stranded with a dead battery, she says there are a few things to keep in mind, including parking your car in a garage if possible, plugging in your car and turning off your heater fan and radio when you come home at the end of the day. so when you get up in the morning especially in the next couple of days when you go to turn on your car the energy isn t being pulled by anything else, says orfanakos. if your car needs to be boosted more than two or three times, it s likely time for a new battery, she says.the caa also suggests keeping a safety kit in the car that includes items like mitts, blankets, food, water, ice scrapers and jumper cables however, ifyou don t know how to use the cables, orfanakos says it s best to call for help.despite the cold, the ncc says the rideau canal skateway is not safe and urges skaters to stay off the ice.jasmine leduc, communications officer with the ncc, says recent snow and rain have slowed down the ice formation. the ncc s skateway team is monitoring conditions and focusing on snow removal and flooding overnight. in the meantime the ncc asks the public to remain off the rideau canal as the ice is still dangerously thin, says leduc. and the ice thickness must measure at least 30 centimetres to accommodate the weight of the public on the skateway.

2015-01-05,"Liberals hope to escape past, chart new future with military candidates","justin trudeau s liberals are hoping to capitalize on the cracks that have appeared in the conservatives pro - military image, especially when it comes to veterans.to accomplish that goal, the liberals will have a number of former and currently serving military members running under their banner, including retired lieutenant -

uprising by some former military personnel by closing several veterans affairs offices. there was also anger over layoffs and the department returning more than 1 billion to the federal treasury since 2006.in addition, auditor general michael ferguson released a stinging report on wait times for mental health services in november, while the government was accused of trickery after it was revealed 200 million in new funding for mental health services was to be spread out over 50 years.veterans affairs minister julian fantino s abrasive nature has only made matters worse, as he was captured on camera arguing with veterans in january and then being chased down a hallway by the wife of a veteran suffering from ptsd in june.in a recent roundtable interview with the citizen, several liberal candidates with previous military experience were scathing in their assessment of how the conservative government has treated veterans.david macleod served 27 years in the canadian army until he was medically released in 2010 due to chronic pain in his left leg, which was shot in a training accident in 1991. a former card - carrying conservative, macleod faces the tall task of beating justice minister peter mackay. when i was released, what i found was that there was a great deal of bureaucracy and a great deal of pushback with my application, said macleod, who has also worked with several veterans groups since leaving the military.he is also on his third case manager. one was burnt out from having too many cases, he says, while another was essentially fired when she refused to transfer to halifax because the government had shuttered the veterans affairs office in sydney. many veterans are facing the exact same challenges, macleod said. the bureaucratic processes that are part of this are starting to fall apart because of the cuts, and it s the front line cuts that are having the biggest, biggest impact on veterans. marc miller served as an army reservist from 1990 to 1994. now he is a lawyer running for the liberals in the newly created montreal riding of ville marie. he said there is an essential bond of trust between veterans and the government, which has been damaged. no person serving in the military ever thinks about getting injured, miller said. they get in there wanting to serve. but when they are injured, canadians in turn owe them that duty. when that s broken, it s very difficult to repair. a former canadian army commander who is now running for the liberals in orl ans, leslie said there are lots of voices which are now crying out for some sort of redress to the current veterans situation. why mr. harper has chosen to declare war on veterans, against people who have fought for their nation, leslie said, and why he refuses to treat veterans with the dignity and the respect and the resources they ve earned is beyond me. the liberals are hoping to convince canadians, particularly disaffected veterans, that they are best placed to undo the damage and fulfil that duty. but it may take more than platitudes to convince veterans as well as serving military members to vote liberal.you can currently count the number of liberal mps with military experience on two fingers.marc garneau served in the navy for 15 years, rising to the rank of captain before his career as an astronaut forced him to leave in 1989. kevin lamoureux spent three years in uniform in the 1980s as an air traffic controller until he was elected to manitoba s legislative assembly.contrast that with the seven former canadian forces members currently serving as conservative mps, including retired brigadier - general gordon o connor and retired lieutenant - colonels laurie hawn, pierre lemieux and ted opitz.the ndp boast the same number of veterans in their caucus, with alex atamanenko and christine moore having spent several years in uniform. a third, jean - fran ois larose, left the ndp to form a new party in october. many current and former canadian forces members have vivid memories of the belt - tightening that occurred within the military during the so - called decade of darkness in the 1990s, when jean chr tien s liberal government slashed the military to cut spending and balance the books.in a recent interview, conservative mp erin o toole said the liberal government neglected the military, and he questioned why anyone who has served in uniform would run for the party. all of these people, in one way or another, served during the 90s, he said of the current crop of liberal candidates with military experience. they re going to have to come to terms with the fact that they re joining a party that historically has not considered the canadian forces as important to our country and our foreign policy and our domestic security situation as conservative governments have. former lieutenant - colonel karen mccrimmon, who is running in the ottawa - area riding of carleton - mississippi mills, said chr tien had no choice but to cut to protect the economy. our credit rating as a country, it was seriously endangering our future, she said. did we make some sacrifices in the 90s yes we did. but there was an objective. it was short - term pain for long - term gain. the liberal candidates also note it was pierre trudeau who started the ball rolling on buying cf - 18s and other equipment for the military in the 1970s and 80s, and that paul martin injected billions of new dollars into the canadian forces when he was prime minister.they argue that rhetoric aside, the conservatives own record is far from flawless, not just when it comes to veterans, but the military as well. for example, billions of dollars in budget cuts and significant problems with a number of military procurements are putting significant pressure on the canadian forces. there is what we call a say - do gap with this government, mccrimmon said. oh, they talk a good story. but what do they actually do what new equipment is actually showing up there yet it s not completely clear what the liberals will do differently when it comes to veterans or the military, aside from reopening the nine veterans affairs offices the government closed.the party has pledged to ensure that no veteran will have to fight the government for the treatment and compensation they have earned by putting their lives on the line for this country. exactly how they will do that hasn t been explained.liberal leader justin trudeau has also said little about how he will fulfil that pledge or about his plans for the canadian forces, aside from saying canada should have focused on humanitarian aid to iraq rather than whipping out our cf - 18s. leslie, who in addition to running in orl ans is also one of trudeau s foreign and military advisers, would not comment on what the liberal leader plans to do. he did note the liberals plan to scrap the conservatives income - splitting plan, which would free up 2 billion per year. that is crying out for re - allocation, leslie said, especially when the argument is the current income - splitting plan is essentially being paid for on the backs of veterans and the troops, the sailors and the aircrew. however, the idea the liberals would reinvest the money into veterans affairs and national defence rather than some type of voter - friendly social program seems unlikely at best.sajjan did one tour in bosnia and three in afghanistan, including one in 2006 in which four of his soldiers were killed during two weeks of fierce fighting with the taliban. he suggested the most important thing is just having input when the tough decisions are being made. soldiers out of the woodworks are calling and sending facebook messages and saying, way to go. you re experience will be needed, sajjan said. it s not about the party. it s because they know you ll have a voice, because you ve earned that trust in some very difficult situations.

2015-01-05,Letter: Celebrate Mackenzie instead,"re , january 3it might seem fashionable for some to celebrate the bicentennial of sir john a. macdonald s birth, but columnist brian crowley has got it wrong. rather than being an underrated statesman, macdonald has been sadly overrated. macdonald was very much a self - serving opportunist who was artful in remaining in office by handing out political favours and co - opting others into his government. he was caught accepting bribes and orchestrated the double shuffle and widespread electoral gerrymandering.contrary to some views, sir john a. macdonald was not the father of confederation. there were many great and honorable men who contributed to the collective vision; hence fathers of confederation.and many of the institutions that have helped to preserve and protect our democracy e.g. the supreme court of canada; electoral reform including the secret ballot, same day national voting, protection from electoral fraud, ending property qualifications for candidates; the office of the auditor general; and the royal military college were all brought in by the liberal government of macdonald s chief political opponent and nemesis, alexander mackenzie. if anyone fought for the rights of the individual, limited government, an independent judiciary and the rule of law, demonstrably, it was mackenzie, not macdonald.unlike macdonald, the self - educated stonemason mackenzie was known for utmost honesty and integrity, unyielding principles and passionate belief in equality. from his humble working class background, he rose to the highest position in the land through hard work and personal sacrifice. he declined offers of knighthood three times. i submit these values and qualities, that make us canadians, are more derived from people like alexander mackenzie than macdonald.while mackenzie was a strict teetotaler, i am sure he would not object to us raising a toast to him on the anniversary of his birth on january 28."
2015-01-05,Public Citizen: Not a great year but one Quyon couple 'can live with',"their health issues haven t gone away and they are living on a short leash financially, but, says garry belair, he and his wife, lisa beausoleil, are coping and still hoping for better days.in the meantime, belair has a new job though it is voluntary and he calls it more of a hobby. he has become chief of the pontiac and outaouais algonquins, an off - reserve tribe of about 300 members from pembroke to st - j rome, que. offered the post last may, belair heads the group, which advocates for similar rights and benefits offered to natives who live on reserves.a little over a year ago, the quyon couple was down and depressed. christmas was a couple of weeks away, and their lives were pretty bleak. belair said looking at his christmas tree made him feel sad. belair, a school - bus driver, hadn t worked in months because of very serious eye affliction, and beausoleil was still convalescing from major operations for knee bone displacements and ligament problems in both legs. until belair took medical leave in august 2013, the couple, high - school sweethearts, had been living on one salary since 2011. belair was able to supplement his pay after his wife lost her job by working extra hours driving other types of buses for his employer, bigras transport.after belair went on sick leave due to vision problems a cyst was found behind his right eye, and his left was hemorrhaging he collected employment insurance, but the benefits ended after 15 weeks. suddenly, things went from bad to desperate. quebec social services refused to help them because they owned a house luckily, they had purchased mortgage insurance and two old vehicles. government bureaucrats suggested they sell their assets, live on the money until it ran out and then apply for welfare. belair suggested they be allowed to collect welfare, and that they would return the money after they were working again.a public citizen story on the couple s plight resulted in cash and grocery donations from the community and abroad. even a well - wisher from arizona offered them words of encouragement and some money. citizen readers offered to pay for dog food so they would not have to put their beloved cocker spaniel up for adoption. following the public outpouring, quebec social services saw the light and agreed to offer welfare assistance to the couple, both of whom are now 32.a year later, belair says, everything is looking pretty good. the fact is things could be a lot better, but belair isn t going to complain, especially after what they went through in 2013.the cyst was removed from his right eye during an operation last may, and he says his vision has improved considerably. but his left eye is still hemorrhaging. doctors have since found cysts in that eye, and like what he had to undergo for his right, belair is treated with drugs that are administered to his left eye with a needle. the needle is extremely painful, he says.doctors are hopeful the left eye can also be treated successfully, even if it requires an operation. belair says doctors believe he can have 20 - 20 vision again, which would enable him to drive again for a living.his wife, he says, is having abdominal surgery in mid - january after both her knees were operated on in november. doctors removed plates and screws that had been inserted in her previous operations, because her body was rejecting them. they are now hoping her knees can heal without the inserts.beausoleil, too, says she is generally good, though it depends on the time of the day. the quebec health ministry covers about 70 per cent of the cost of their prescriptions; the couple covers the remainder with the money they get from social services. we are living on a short leash cheque - by - cheque, belair says. but we are surviving with that. is something bothering you please contact "
2015-01-05,"Julian Fantino shuffled out of Veterans Affairs, Erin O'Toole promoted","looking to mend a threadbare relationship with canada s veterans, prime minister stephen harper moved embattled minister julian fantino out of veterans affairs monday and promoted rising star and former canadian forces member erin o toole to the post.the file had become a political vulnerability for the conservative government in recent months, due in part to missteps by the gaffe - prone fantino. replacing him gives the prime minister an opportunity to start over at veterans affairs while also bringing a fresh face into his cabinet.it s a meteoric rise for o toole, a 41 - year - old former lawyer and military officer first elected an mp in late 2012. the new minister faces enormous challenges, however, including earning back the trust of veterans fed up with the government.some veterans advocates, and the opposition parties, say a new minister won t change the conservatives message or policies, which they feel have shortchanged many former soldiers.the ministers were sworn in to their new portfolios monday in a small ceremony at rideau hall.o toole, a former canadian forces helicopter navigator, was parliamentary secretary to the international trade minister before the shuffle, but had often been called on to comment for the government on veterans issues. it s an honour for me to serve our veterans, o toole told reporters on the way out of rideau hall. i served, myself, and they re some of our finest. o toole earned his wings as the tactical co - ordinator aboard sea king helicopters and was posted to canadian forces base shearwater in nova scotia. the sea kings are based on canadian warships and their primary role is hunting submarines.fantino is a former police chief. in an emailed statement, he said i will remain forever grateful to the countless veterans i had the distinct honour of meeting in all regions of canada, and while abroad visiting the cemeteries of those brave men and women who died in service to their country. each and every day that i served at veteran affairs i was guided by a firm belief that government must stand by those who have served and continue to serve. fantino didn t walk away empty - handed monday. he is now associate minister of national defence his second stint in the post. this time, his focus will be on the areas of arctic sovereignty, information technology security and foreign intelligence.the royal canadian legion said it welcomed the announcement of a new veterans affairs minister, but called the shuffle a political move. the legion said it hopes the change brings better action from the conservative government on veterans issues. the legion has great expectations that this government and all political parties will put the past behind and move forward to create an environment where veterans know that this country s obligation to care for them when they need it will be met, tom eagles, dominion president of the royal canadian legion, said in a news release.former veterans ombudsman pat stogran, a retired canadian forces colonel, said veterans flooded him with messages monday stating they were unhappy with o toole s appointment.he said that s because o toole has demonstrated he ll say whatever is necessary to get ahead in government. this is just window - dressing, stogran said. there s a reason why o toole just received the post it s because he has no qualms going public with the party line, which i would say is hugely disingenuous. o toole s comments on veterans issues in recent months including defending the more than 1 billion in funding returned to the federal treasury have already shown he has little credibility on the file, stogran argued.earning the trust of many veterans will be unattainable for the minister, he argued.ndp leader tom mulcair, who had been calling for fantino s resignation over his treatment of veterans, congratulated o toole on his appointment to cabinet, but called on the new minister to reopen nine veterans affairs offices the government has closed across canada over the last year or so.the government s problems on veterans issues go well beyond one decision or fantino s handling of the file, mulcair said. the closing of those nine offices was not the idea of one man. it was the idea of the harper conservative government, mulcair said.mulcair said harper has begun an election year with the half - hearted demotion of an incompetent minister in fantino, who, he said, was behind the federal government s f - 35 fighter jet debacle during his previous stint as associate minister of defence.liberal veterans critic frank valeriote said o toole may be a new minister, but he doesn t expect anything will change from the government. the conservatives have signalled the government has no social covenant or sacred obligation to veterans, valeriote said. perhaps his background as a veteran gives the appearance of a more informed minister, he said. but as informed as he might be and as soft as the tone may be delivered, it s still the same message. the conservatives troubles on the veterans file started spiking a year ago when some former military personnel objected to the closing of the nine veterans affairs offices. there has also been anger over layoffs at vac and news reports about the department returning more than 1 billion to the federal treasury since 2006.also, auditor general michael ferguson released a scathing report on wait times for mental health services in november, while the government faced further criticism after it was revealed 200 million in new funding for mental - health services for veterans was to be spread out over 50 years.once seen as a rising star in the conservative government, fantino rapidly became a lightning rod for disgruntled veterans.part of their animosity can be traced to public relations mistakes by fantino while at veterans affairs.in january 2014, tv footage of fantino involved in a testy exchange with aging veterans went viral. he had shown up 70 minutes late for a meeting with them and was greeted by a finger - jabbing former soldier upset with cuts to veterans services. this finger - pointing stuff doesn t really work very well with me, fantino said.the minister later tried to explain the government s position, at which point a veteran responded hogwash. fantino abruptly walked away.he later apologized but also accused the veterans of being dupes of the union representing workers at veterans affairs.in may, fantino was once again captured on camera as he was chased down the hallway by the wife of a veteran suffering from ptsd.in late november, when the auditor general released his critical report on veterans access to mental health services, fantino was in italy. although he was there on an anniversary trip with veterans, the calls for his resignation intensified.harper has tried to stanch the criticism in recent months, for instance appointing walter natynczyk, the former chief of defence staff, as deputy minister of veterans affairs in november. with files from lee berthiaume and david pugliese, ottawa citizen"
2015-01-05,House Works: Tool libraries offer affordable choice to DIYers,"scottish philosopher thomas carlyle may have been born in 1795, but he said something about tools that s at least as true today as ever man is a tool - using animal. without tools he is nothing, with tools he is all. this notion is behind a growing canadian and international movement that provides tools and workspaces for people who couldn t otherwise afford them. it s one of the best things to happen to the do - it - yourself movement, and for more than just obvious reasons.tool libraries are cooperatives where members pay small monthly or annual fees to get access to tools. makerspaces sometimes called hackerspaces include cooperative sharing and low - cost fees, but also workshop space for people who want to make good things happen with their hands.it s a great way to empower creative people, but it s also something that promises to revolutionize the way creativity turns into reality because of the kind of people it draws together into community.toronto is home to one of the leading tool libraries and makerspace venues, not only in canada but also the world. i find it hugely inspiring to see just how far this movement can go when i look at what s happening in toronto. you can the co - founder of the toronto tool library in action.so what s the difference between a not - for - profit tool library and a tool rental business cost is one thing. annual fees range from 50 to 100 per year for unlimited access to the entire tool collection, and that s pretty cheap. you could easily spend that much to rent one tool for one day in the open market.one of the newest tool libraries in canada is the . it bills itself as a not - for - profit community venture, and it s just starting up now. co - founder bettina vollmerhausen is typical of the kind of enthusiastic people you ll find behind the movement, and she expects the library to open its doors early this year. once we re up and running, people will be able to become a member of the tool library and we ll make it very affordable, she explains. we don t want to exclude anyone. in november, i launched a tool giveaway contest on my website, but something went wrong. three high - end tools were up for grabs by anyone who produced the best video about their best or worst diy project, as determined by crowd voting. despite lots of traffic and interest, we never actually got any videos. a surprise to me, but a good thing for four tool libraries in canada.the ottawa tool library will be getting a terrific set of pro - grade screw extractors from irwin. these are just the tools you need to remove broken bolts and screws from machines and motors.the sudbury tool library will be getting a 20 - volt cordless framing nailer from dewalt. it drives full - size framing nails up to 3 inches long into wood without need for an air compressor or hose. a standard cordless tool battery provides the power.the halifax tool library will be getting the latest air - powered finishing nailer from bostitch, an 18 - gauge model that s perfect for installing trim and moulding of all kinds.the calgary tool library will be getting a stanley cross 90 self - leveling laser. it s ideal for laying out all kinds of projects, from drop ceilings to wall tiles.tool libraries and makerspaces are part of a wider movement called the sharing economy , and it promises to empower people to do things they couldn t do on their own. i can t wait to see what happens."
2015-01-05,Peter Raaymakers: Senators a good historical fit for LeBreton,"ottawa is buzzing over recent news that the senators are actively considering an application to work with the national capital commission in making a brand new professional hockey arena part of the redevelopment of lebreton flats. the ncc is looking for a bold, new anchor institution, though, and the arena would need a bit more flash in order to meet those criteria.one consideration would be building the arena to be more than just an arena. presumably it will feature restaurants and shops that are open on non - game days even the canadian tire centre, isolated as it is, has those , but incorporating some locally or nationally relevant institution would certainly help the senators case. there s no need to re - create the hockey hall of fame, but relocating the ottawa sport hall of fame from its current location at city hall to a major sports venue makes a lot of sense to me, and would add valuable public space to a largely private venue.if the ottawa sport hall of fame wouldn t consider a move, a brand - new local hockey hall of fame or even a senators hall of fame bringing together the history of the original and the modern local pro hockey teams could work well, too.this brings up another key issue for the senators to consider when pitching a plan for lebreton, which is the planned arena s proximity to the canadian war museum. the sens regularly recognize members of the armed forces for their service, highlighted by armed forces night, which are laudable. and the team at least its namesake is linked to canada s war history.the greatest of the original ottawa senators was almost undoubtedly frank one - eyed mcgee, who once scored 14 goals in a single stanley cup game during the period when the ottawa team was known as the silver seven. he retired after the 1906 season with 131 goals in just 45 games, despite the fact that he d lost sight in his left eye before his playing career began.after his playing career, mcgee enlisted in the canadian army at the outset of the first world war and was mobilized to england in may of 1915. in december of 1915, the armoured car in which he was travelling through belgium was hit with a she will, sending mcgee back to england with a knee injury. after recovering from his injury, mcgee was offered a desk job, which he refused. he returned to the front lines in august 1916, fighting in one of the most significant military battles in canadian history, the battle of the somme.mcgee died on september 16, 1916, one of more than 24,000 canadian fatalities during the battle of the somme. he was 33 years old.although mcgee s legacy as one of the greatest professional hockey players is acknowledged he was among the first players elected to the hockey hall of fame he s not well known as a war hero who made the ultimate sacrifice during the first world war.a pro hockey arena and a national museum of military history seem like mismatched neighbours, but there s a fit here, represented by frank mcgee. the new arena should include a nod to the senators past, and its connection with the institution that would neighbour the arena."

2015-01-05,Catharine Parr Traill's wild flower book (with video),"catharine parr traill was one of canada s best - known authors in the 1860s, so when she proposed a book on canadian wildflowers, the publisher readily agreed.there was just one catch traill and her niece, the illustrator, wanted colour pictures. the printer could only do black and white.that didn t stop traill. more importantly, it didn t stop the niece, agnes fitzgibbon, who gathered her five daughters and sat down together and hand painted all 10 full - page plates in all 500 copies of canadian wild flowers.two copies from the original 500 are still in the canadian museum of nature s climate - controlled collection of old books in the museum s research and storage building on pink road in aylmer.there librarian elizabeth debeljak sometimes brings them out for visiting researchers, who still sometimes want to see details of the pictures. plants change over time, and from one place to another, and botanists study the changes. they were all coloured by hand, one at a time, debeljak said. she turns the pages gently with a little metal spatula made for carving wax. fingers must never touch the old paper.each coloured page shows a collection of three or four plants, mostly flowers wild rose, indian turnip or jack - in - the - pulpit , white trilliums, trout lily. there s a flower she calls purple trillium, though in later years traill called it red, as we do today.the printer made faint dotted outlines and the mother and five daughters took the job from there, working by candlelight in the evenings.the book was a good prospect because traill already had a literary reputation, especially for the backwoods of canada written in 1836, four years after she immigrated from england . but the publisher still wouldn t commit until they had sold all 500 copies in advance.that s when traill s extended family went to work painting; the library staff believe they used colours they mixed themselves from plant extracts. the book doesn t say which woman coloured which picture, but you can see subtle variations between its two copies.the whole thing has a victorian feel to it; there are bits of poetry scattered throughout, and the writing is gaudier than what you ll see in a plant guide today. it s a window onto the cultural world as well as the natural one. here s the water lily who that has ever floated upon one of our calm inland lakes, on a warm july or august day, but has been tempted, at the risk of upsetting the frail birch - bark canoe or shallow skiff, to put forth a hand to snatch one of those matchless ivory cups that rest in spotless purity upon the tranquil water, just rising and falling with the movement of the stream; or have gazed with wishful and admiring eyes into the still clear water, at the exquisite buds and half unfolded blossoms that are springing upwards to the air and sun - light. the hollow boat - shaped sepals of the calyx are four in number, of a bright olive green, smooth and oily in texture. the flowers do not expand fully until they reach the surface historian michael a. peterman has this to say in the dictionary of canadian biography though she was not a critical scientist she brought a passion to her study that has won her considerable admiration. under less adverse circumstances her work might have been published earlier, thereby earning her a more significant place in the evolution of botanical studies in canada. traill also loved and preserved ferns, tiny flowers, and mosses, even one sample of poison ivy that can still make people react today.her albums are also kept with considerable reverence, guarded by micheline bouchard, a botany technician who is a big fan of traill. when traill died in lakefield, near peterborough, in 1899 aged 97 , she left thousands of dried and pressed specimens that are now in the museum, mostly in envelopes, some in simple scrapbooks.there s a whole album that s mostly dried seaweed. most plants are faded, but there is a larkspur that is still blue.bouchard has identified the collection parts by the look of each album cover rather than traditional scientific language. one is victorian lady cameo. others are cat s eye paper, marble paper and so on. one contains flowers picked beside her sister s grave in england and sent to canada. but she was poor for a long time. she didn t have the luxury of buying the very nice paper. the cheap paper was acidic and falls apart easily.catharine parr traill wrote a longer and more famous book on plants nearly 20 years later, when she was in her 80s. studies of plant life in canada was a bigger success. again, agnes fitzgibbon now agnes chamberlin illustrated it.james fletcher, the dominion entomologist and botanist at the central experimental farm, called it one of the greatest botanical triumphs which anyone could achieve.

2015-01-05,"Wit and wisdom of Gerry Mulligan, weed scientist","in his 86 years, gerry mulligan has collected a lot of information about weeds. you tend to get poison ivy where your skin is very thin between the fingers. people with very light skin tend to get poison ivy more than people with thick skin or pigmented skin. the active ingredient has to touch the cells beneath the skin. if your skin is too thick you don t tend to get poison ivy. and once you get poison ivy you become super - sensitive to it in the future. as a general rule, plants with showy flowers produce small amounts of sticky pollen that adhere to insects and other flower visitors and is transferred by them to the stigmas of other plants, usually of the same species. plants with inconspicuous flowers, usually have light pollen that is blown indiscriminately by the wind. this wasteful pollination strategy requires that the anthers on these plants produce large amounts of pollen. it is the plants with inconspicuous flowers, not those with showy flowers, that because most hay fever in humans.. might be the dandelion. dandelion is a very interesting weed because it is one of the weeds that does not require fertilization. that means each plant produces seeds with out the need for pollination by another plant. it s got a tap root, very deep to get the moisture. plus it s got the pappus which are these little parachutes with the seed on them. it s perfect. the only problem with dandelion was that it was very susceptible to 2,4 - d. but you can t use 2,4 - d any more, so dandelion is everywhere now. native south of our area. sold around christmas. mild poisonings have been reported after the ingestion of berries."

2015-01-06,Family's roots run deep in Ottawa's Experimental Farm,"gerry mulligan has spent 84 of his 86 years at the central experimental farm, mostly as a weed scientist. but that s just the tip of the iceberg lettuce.five or six generations of mulligans have worked this fertile land. it s hard to count them all exactly after 158 years.gerry mulligan goes in to study weeds in the afternoons. he s unpaid, but agriculture and agri - food canada gives him free parking not exactly breaking the bank and used of a shared lab. he enjoys the company of bright young scientists.he is also is keenly aware of his family heritage, especially as he sees pieces of the farm being whittled away for development.the mulligans came from ireland in 1842, settling first at hog s back, and in 1856 they acquired a farm lot up near dow s lake. part of it was expropriated to build the rideau canal, and most of the rest became the central experimental farm in 1886. the arboretum is old mulligan land. so is the former green valley restaurant site, and mulligan florists.it s a pattern seen all over ontario cities gobble up nearby farms, and the families on them disperse.but the mulligans were stubborn. they stayed, adapting as times changed by taking jobs with agriculture canada.gerry s grandfather, alec, was a farm foreman in charge of the bull gang in the early 1900s. they were labourers. gerry thinks alec is the one who put red posts with white tops all around the property.gerry s father, wilfred, ran the greenhouse for the cereal division. it s the greenhouse right near the ornamental gardens, he said. wilfred also used to work outside during the summer. the cereal division produced new varieties of grain, and this is where gerry s own story begins, about 1930. my father often used to go in on the weekend to water plants in the greenhouse and i used to ride on his bicycle, on the handlebars, when i was two or there years old. wilfred had joined the canadian expeditionary force as a private in the first world war. he said he walked from the shores of france to germany and back again. he didn t get a ride, and he was in the trenches. when the war ended he was hired at the experimental farm, too, and stayed until he was 67 or 68 years old.gerry s uncle clifford and uncle alfie, wilfred s brothers, were employees on the farm, too.and all the time young gerry was spending a lot of time on the farm as a child, and later as a high school and university student doing summer jobs. i always liked plants. always liked the open spaces and the greenery. i used to go to the arboretum and swing on the trees. it just was very peaceful. gerry mulligan got a job there as a technician soon after he left high school. it was the first time he had met people with university educations, and he decided to study agriculture at macdonald college in montreal, now part of mcgill university.since 1952 he has been a research associate studying weeds. it puts him in an odd position. today s research scientists need a phd in their field, often followed by several years as post - doctoral fellows, or as junior scientists on someone s staff.mulligan had only a bachelor s degree. he had been a field labourer. yet he rose to become acting director general of all the research stations in agriculture canada.his secret when somebody left for another job or retired, and somebody needed to do their job, i was the one they asked to do it temporarily. and each time he stuck with it. that s how i got to be acting director general. all the way along i was acting for someone else who had left. his emeritus status is going well. he was co - author of two journal papers last year and another this year.he also runs websites on common weeds, on poisonous plants, hay fever plants and more.but mulligan worries that the farm is being chipped away. it disturbed him that when land was given to the ottawa hospital this fall, it was just announced as a fait accompli. it should survive. it s important that it does survive. but i m afraid politicians are such that if it s in their interest to carve a piece off, they will. and i m afraid piece by piece, they re going to be carving pieces off. it will just go on. if it s to the advantage of a developer or a mayor wants more tax money, they just get rid of the land. it will deprive the city of greenery, he says. it will also pave over land that soaks up heavy rain and make the area more prone to flooding.a quarter - century ago the farm sold off a section of rocky land good only for sheep or chickens. the retirement home that i m in now is on that property, he said. so gerry mulligan remains tied to the land that his family has farmed since 1856."

2015-01-06,Police chief won't ask for more money to fight gangs,"ottawa s police chief says he won t be pressuring council to increase the police budget to hire new officers, even after councillors and the police union urged him to fight for more resources for what the union says is an understaffed and overworked force.despite a record year of gun violence in the capital 49 shootings in 52 weeks of 2014 chief charles bordeleau says he isn t convinced that asking for more money is a strategy the force needs to employ to combat gang violence. it s not a budget issue, from my perspective, bordeleau told the citizen on monday.bordeleau also said interested councillors are welcome to meet with him or his staff at any time but he won t be flouting process by going over the police board s head. it s not appropriate for me to go before council because of governance issues, bordeleau said.as chief of police, bordeleau reports to the seven - member civilian police services board. if councillors wish a formal briefing, it must be before the board, bordeleau said, and councillors are welcome to a presentation about gangs at the next board meeting. police also sent a shootings - related status report to all councillors over the holidays.bordeleau said he disagreed with recent arguments made by ottawa police association president matt skof.in an op - ed in tuesday s citizen, skof called the failure of the chief and mayor to advocate for and increase resources to the police service a paralysis of leadership. the urgent need to shift resources to the guns and gangs unit in the wake of surging gun violence across the city has finally exposed the folly of years of budget - politics, skof wrote.skof and bordeleau both agreed that shifting resources to supplement the guns and gangs unit is warranted, but while bordeleau said it s what a flexible service has to be able to do, skof suggested it s simply a band - aid solution that leaves other areas of policing vulnerable. the problem with these resource shifts is that the police chief continues to raid the resources of one area of the service to shore up the holes in another, skof wrote. this approach to police staffing may satisfy an occasional, unpredicted need, but as a systemic response to increasing demands within a police service the practice becomes a recipe for disaster. asked whether the current size of the force means officers are stretched too thinly, bordeleau acknowledged that workloads are high. they do have a lot of work on their plate. i understand that, bordeleau said. he said the service continues to identify workload pressures that can be she would to return officers to core policing.mayor jim watson was on leave and not available for an interview monday. his press secretary wrote in an email that watson has been in constant contact with chief bordeleau and police services board chair eli el - chantiry and has been working on the draft city budget for the past several weeks. the mayor will, as he has in the past, ensure the police are adequately funded to keep our city safe, brook simpson wrote.the mayor is scheduled to meet with both bordeleau and el - chantiry next week.bordeleau said he will update the police board on the force s gang strategy at its monthly meeting on january 26."

2015-01-06,Senators penalty killers get too much practice,"quietly, the ottawa senators are becoming one of the better teams in the league at killing penalties.maybe it s because they get so much practice at it.in sunday s 4 - 2 home - ice loss to tampa bay, the senators played more than 14 minutes shorthanded, successfully killing eight of nine penalties. and yet, that one power play goal was big. tyler johnson s back - door goal tied the game at two, and 47 seconds later, steven stamkos scored the game winner, off a long solo effort.the senators are now the third most penalized team in the nhl, playing shorthanded on average 12.5 minutes per game. oddly enough, lowly carolina leads the league in discipline with 7.7 penalty minutes per game. the chicago blackhawks are next at 7.8.to their credit, the senators rank 10th among league penalty kill units, at 82.9 per cent. a tip of the cap to assistant coach mark reeds, who directs ottawa s penalty killing, with help from jason smith.against tampa, the pk unit was in overdrive.even by the senators standards of being undisciplined, sunday s game was brutal. nine minor penalties including three to erik karlsson, one for unsportsmanlike conduct.winger erik condra was in kill mode for half of his ice time. he played 12 minutes, 38 seconds and was on the pk for 6 04 of that time.defencemen jared cowen and cody ceci each played more than seven minutes shorthanded. defencemen eric gryba and chris phillips, plus forwards milan michalek, david legwand and alex chiasson, were among the other primary penalty killers.discipline has been an issue for so long in the nation s capital, there ought to be a federal commission to investigate. among the 30 nhl teams, ottawa has been among the worst sinners in each of the past five seasons this year 27th, 12.5 pims per game. 2013 - 14 27th, 13.3 pims per game. 2012 - 13 28th, 13.6 pims per game. 2011 - 12 29th, 14 pims per game. 2010 - 11 25th, 14 pims per game.of course, that includes misconducts and fighting majors.even more telling last season, the senators were dead last in the nhl in times shorthanded 320. this year, 27th.theories, people i wish there was an easy answer, phillips says. we ve talked about it lots, being disciplined. quite often the penalties we take are just careless. careless, lazy penalties, where you get a stick in there, and it s just automatic now. head coach dave cameron blamed sunday s penalties on fatigue and frustration, but also felt there were a few questionable calls. indeed, referees eric furlatt and chris rooney seemed to be on a hooking crusade with six calls between the two teams.cameron calls discipline an on - going issue we deal with all the time. for obvious reasons. but the record suggests they re running uphill on a treadmill. sometimes when we do get down, we get frustrated, condra says. your mind isn t in the right spot and you re doing something silly. the pattern of taking penalties is, if nothing else, consistent. but how to explain the roller - coaster that is the penalty killing unit in that lockout - shortened 2012 - 13 season, the senators were the league s top - rated pk squad, with a kill rate of 88 per cent.last year, they fell all the way to 22nd, at 80.9 per cent.now, they re back up to 10th 82.9 per cent . when you re called upon, you ve got to take ownership of it, condra says. going from first in the nhl to 22nd, that s a little shot at your pride. we saw that, and understood. condra thinks it helps to have consistency in personnel. as they are getting more familiar with each other, they are getting more shorthanded offensive opportunities as well.ceci says the penalty kill group is encouraged to be aggressive when the opportunity is there. but condra says that only works when all four players defending are in unison. this has been the key to the pk s success, in his view. i think we re tight and we move as one, condra says. and when there is pressure we all pressure. when we sit back, we stay in tight. when one guy s going and two are staying in tight, that s when you get in trouble. if we re a cohesive unit, as we have been, it s better. typical of ceci s maturity the kid is 21 going on 30 in terms of poise under pressure he is developing, along with cowen, into a key figure in ottawa s penalty killing forces. it s never fun just blocking shots, but it s something the team needs you to do to win, ceci says. we killed a lot of penalties against a really good power play. it wasn t a good idea to be in the box as much as we were but we ended up doing a pretty good job. we do a lot of video, try to improve on little things. reeds takes a lot of pride in it and so do we. for 37 games, ceci was penalty - free. they got him in game 38, a questionable second - period hook on brian boyle sunday that ended ceci s run of games without a penalty. i didn t think i was getting called for that, ceci said. but it was bound to happen. there have been a few times when a call could have gone either way. they finally just buckled down and called the first one. it s too bad, i only get one all year and they score on it. chris phillips did not hear from the nhl over his hit to the head of lightning forward jonathan drouin. nor did he expect to. it was an awkward play at the blueline, with no intent to injure. i tried to get my arm out there to kind of straight - arm him in the chest to keep him from going in, phillips said. with my momentum, and him trying to miss, he ran into my shoulder was how i thought it went down. phillips received a two - minute minor for a check to the head. hockeyscanner"

2015-01-06,"Reevely: Not much comes of Harper-Wynne meeting, but it's better than nothing","northern ontario s mineral deposits won t get mined if we don t build roads and rail lines to the minerals, ontario s premier and canada s prime minister agreed monday night. it s a pretty scant result, but it s the best that premier kathleen wynne could do in touting how productive a meeting they had.the face - to - face in toronto, before stephen harper went to the air canada centre to watch the junior - hockey championship game and wynne went home to catch it on tv, is the first time the two leaders have talked in person in more than a year. mostly, the way wynne told it tuesday morning, they had an exchange they practically could have had by text. stephen i want you 2 spend more on infrstrcture no. ps i hate ur pension scheme. they did agree that more needs to be done about the water on first nations reserves and about greenhouse - gas emissions, wynne reported.agreeing that problems exist is very different from agreeing on what to do about them. as wynne said we had a productive discussion. we talked about how our governments are addressing the challenges that people face. they already know, of course, how each government is addressing the challenges that people face. wynne and harper are intelligent people who got into politics for opposite reasons wynne believes deeply in the power of an activist government to do good. she wants government support for the auto industry, billions of dollars for roads and bridges and transit lines, a price on carbon - dioxide emissions, a more generous national pension plan.harper s mission is to get the government out of people s way by making it about as small as possible. many of the things wynne thinks the government is for, harper considers evils occasionally necessary for political reasons. wynne is just the kind of politician harper got into politics to oppose.the differences extend to their styles. wynne likes meetings, having organized a furious schedule of summits with other premiers since winning her majority last spring. i place great importance on fostering collaboration, collaborative relationships and partnerships with the other provinces and all the other levels of government, she said. we may not agree on anything. that s not the case we are able to find agreement but maybe we can t. but it s important that we talk through differences and either agree to disagree or move forward. particularly with quebec s philippe couillard, these sessions have produced specific agreements on what ontario and another government are going to do together. after she met with alberta s jim prentice, they emerged talking about how they understood each other s views on pipelines much better.harper generally doesn t love meetings. fostering collaboration and collaborative relationships isn t his style. he prefers it when governments keep a respectful distance from each other. everybody does best when they re minding their own business.neither approach is necessarily wrong but they aren t readily compatible.where are the two leaders on the same side wynne and harper are both generally free - traders and they want to see that ring of fire mineral deposit developed. and they both want to win votes in ontario. harper, facing an election this year, has a more urgent focus on that than wynne does.harper s repeated brushoffs of the duly elected premier of his country s most populous province, one poised in a time of cheap oil to do better economically than it has recently, reached the point of weirdness. it looked petty and personal to the point of unseemliness. so they have met, after months of wynne s public demands for a sit - down and harper s refusals. according to the premier, it came together on very short notice and on harper s initiative. my hope is now we ll be able to move forward and have a much, much better interaction, wynne said.for canada s two most important politicians to talk from time to time is better than for them not to. a grand partnership between two such different people may not be in the offing, but it definitely isn t if they never speak."
2015-01-06,McLeod: We shouldn't be surprised when cars hit pedestrians,"it s sad that we have to keep talking about this. each month brings more and more stories of collisions involving cars and pedestrians, more and more accidents. of course, these aren t really accidents; they re the foreseeable consequences of the infrastructure we build.cars need to go fast. lots of them. safety be damned.as we approached the holidays, we had another onslaught of accidents . two days before christmas, a man was sent to the hospital by a bus. three days before that, a pedestrian was struck on merivale. two days before that, we had a collision at bank and aylmer it wasn t the first incident at that intersection. there was an accident this past june and another back in january 2013. nothing has been fixed. the danger of that intersection has been accepted by the city. despite any protestations from our civic leaders, the decision has been made. the city we, the city do not care about the safety of our residents.that stretch of bank is a nasty one. the intersection is at the southern foot of the four - lane bank street bridge, with its wide lanes to encourage speeding, and its narrow, poorly maintained sidewalks that are insufficient for the pedestrian traffic they receive.the bridge itself is too dangerous for multi - modal use. drivers regularly ignore the signs imploring them to stay behind cyclists. the city cynically relies on sharrows painted insignia that tell you little more than the danger the street poses to its users. sharrows are as much safety infrastructure as an adt sticker on your front door is a security system.there are other token safety measures to which city planners and leaders can gesture. the speed limit on bank street has been reduced to 40 km hr. but you wouldn t know that from the traffic. cars still regularly zip by at 50, 60, 70 km hr or more. without enforcement and proper infrastructure, a speed limit sign will do nothing to impede a two - tonne death machine racing down the street.there are numerous measures the city should take to make that stretch of bank street safer. the street should be two lanes. it should have wider sidewalks and a cycletrack to act as a buffer between pedestrians and cars. it should have raised crosswalks or intersections this would also alleviate the massive puddles that accumulate in crosswalks during the winter . essentially, the street should be designed to protect the most vulnerable users, rather than treating them as an inconvenience.of course, the issue of driver - on - non - driver violence isn t limited to bank street, nor to the week leading up to christmas. in november, we saw a horrible streak of accidents throughout the city. on the night of november 26, two pedestrians were hit. about eight hours later, a cyclist was killed. the afternoon of the following day, an 81 - year - old man was run over by a school bus he has since died . the next day, a pedestrian was killed on innes road.in four days, five people that we know of were struck by cars; three are dead. it is the city s moral duty to fix this. and yet, all we get is a metaphoric shrug.on august 12, a pedestrian was struck at the intersection of kent and catherine. he died a week later. the driver was charged with failing to stop at a red light or stop sign . the maximum punishment is three demerit points and a 1,000 fine.change isn t coming. there is no political will. it costs too much, and we have decided that a pedestrian s life just isn t worth it.because a pedestrian s life is worth no more than 1,000."

2015-01-06,Blood services boss attacks OPSEU safety ads,"canadian blood services came out swinging against a union advertising campaign that suggested that proposed contract changes would undermine the safety of canada s blood supply and set the stage for a repeat of the 1980s tainted blood scandal.ian mumford, the canadian blood services chief supply chain officer, said canada s blood supply is among the safest in the world, and that ads published monday in 14 newspapers across ontario by the ontario public service employees union is a labour tactic as the two sides head into a last - ditch round of collective bargaining to avert a strike. at canadian blood services, safety is and always will be our top priority, said mumford in an emailed statement. when our record on safety is challenged, as it was in a union - sponsored newspaper ad and youtube video, we have an obligation to respond. let us reassure you the canadian blood system is safe. the cbs, which manages canada s blood supply, was created in 1998 on the recommendation of the krever inquiry into the thousands of canadians who became infected with the aids virus and hepatitis c because of tainted blood products.the tainted blood affair is the biggest public health disaster in canada s history, leading to the high - profile krever inquiry, billions in legal claims and the destruction of public trust in the blood system. while canadian blood services did not exist during the tainted blood tragedy, we learned valuable lessons from this history that guide our decision - making. canada s blood system is vastly different than it was during the 1980s and 90s and is now one of the safest in the world, said mumford.cbs and opseu are squaring off at the bargaining table this week in an attempt to reach a settlement and avoid a strike that could disrupt blood collection across the province.the parties have three days of talks to reach a deal before thursday, when the union can legally strike or the employer can lock out workers.the talks coincided with opseu s ads and videos that invoked the spectre of another tainted blood scandal if cbs proceeds with layoffs and the other contract changes that the union claims will dismantle the services permanent workforce and replace it with cheaper part - time and casual workers.opseu president warren smokey thomas defended the ads, arguing the lesson learned from that tragedy 25 years ago is that the safety and security of the blood supply must be bulletproof. mumford wouldn t comment on what s being proposed in negotiations but he said the safety and reliability of canada s blood system would be not be affected.he said blood collection and testing has changed dramatically since the krever inquiry. decisions are made in an open and transparent manner by consulting widely with patients, medical professionals and other international partners. he said the service uses rigorous tracking and screening systems and state of the art technology to test and process blood products.mumford said cbs has contingency plans if the impasse continues but warned a strike would disrupt services and affect patients.laurie miller, opseu s campaign manager, said the dispute revolves around concessions on existing job security provisions to manage expected layoffs and plans to de - skill the workforce by replacing trained health - care professionals with casual and part - time workers.opseu is one of the cbs s largest bargaining units, representing about 20 per cent of the organizations 4,500 employees. this contract will have a national implications if they de - skill in ontario, it will happen everywhere else and the national blood system may be compromised, said miller.miller said the cbs is also demanding faster processing of blood products and unreasonable production targets which workers fear will compromise existing safeguards and testing of blood products.miller said the union has yet to get a rationale for the cuts. she argues the cbs has plenty of money, reporting assets of 820 million which have been growing at a rate of 20 million since 2010. she said blood is like red gold with a large and growing global demand for blood and blood products.she said the cbs claims there is a blood shortage but yet it closed a thunder bay clinic two years ago and cancelled 100 donor clinics over the past year. the writing is on the wall they want a just - in - time, part - time and casual workforce, she said."

and - a - half ago, was conservative senator doug finley. after his passing, his wife, diane, contacted the turning point to say that doug wanted his music collection, some 10,000 cds, to go back to the store from whence much of it had come. finley was a dual british canadian citizen, and his cd collection included many you.k. collectibles that would easily find homes in ottawa.the store has legions of customers, many of them collectors and many of those obsessive about their cds, lps or dvds. each morning, the store puts out a bin of new releases new in a used way , and every day, between 50 and 100 customers the same people who were in the day before and the day before that come in to see if there s anything in that bin. some are waiting when the store opens at 10 a.m. others arrive every day at lunch, or after work.if the cast of characters is varied, from the homeless to members of parliament, their needs are not all that disparate. they come to connect their lives through music, whether it s a new discovery or an old favourite, music makes them feel good. the thing i like about this business is that at the beginning of the month, these people get their cheques, and even the poorest people like to listen to new music, says turning point co - owner dan gamble. they come in here and i ll treat them the same way i d treat senator doug finley. we treat everyone the same, and i ll talk to them about music, because i know that music is just so important to them. they ll come in and buy three or four cds when they get the cash, and maybe it s not the wisest decision to spend it at the start of the month and not know how the month is going to go, but it makes them happy and it s probably more important to them than it is to people who are wealthier and have bigger collections, because they can t afford to go to the arts centre or the canadian tire centre to see a band. in a way it s their only exposure to music. the turning point is part of a dying, but by no means dead, breed. admittedly you can pretty much count on one hand the good used record stores that remain in ottawa, like one of the desert - island - type lists of five that rob fleming and his staff at championship vinyl, in nick hornby s debut novel, high fidelity, love creating 1. the turning point 2. the record centre 3. legend records 4. vertigo records 5. compact musicyet gamble believes that what has always attracted customers to his store will continue to support this otherwise dwindling industry, those being 1. variety 2. quality 3. reasonable prices 4. knowledgeable staff 5. atmosphere we have the same customers now that we had 15 years ago, he says. it s kind of a corner - store thing, where you hang out and talk. it s a personal thing. we re older guys, and we re pretty much the only ones who face the customers and we do know a lot about music. it s not like when you go to hmv where there s some young guy who s going to university, and you ask him about bad company and he says what here, we kind of know that stuff, and so if you want to talk intelligently, or you say i like luther allison. do you have another bluesman that sounds like him we can offer that kind of service. there s a place in the market for this, he adds, and there should always be a place for this. those of us who love music and love records, and love being able to flip through a whole discography of an artist in a record store, either on cd or vinyl, it s a great thing to have that choice. the store has been around centretown for 31 years, first on somerset street and now on cooper. gamble and his brother tom bought it in 1999 as a sort of semi - retirement project that each thought would be more fun than work. one of the aspects dan has most enjoyed about it over the years has been introducing customers to new to them musicians. 1. robben ford 2. dave alvin 3. richard thompson 4. tab benoit 5. laura nyrobut it s been a little more than a half - century since dan got his first records beatles singles she loves you and i want to hold your hand, which his father bought for him for his 13th birthday in 1963 and the gamble brothers are retiring. save for sunday - afternoon shifts, tom, 61, stepped down at the end of april, while dan expects to also gradually bow out.to that end, he has, since april, been introducing customers to another musician they might not know his 33 - year - old son - in - law, nick beaton, guitarist with local rock band autumns cannon and heir apparent to the turning point. i wanted to keep it going because it s still a viable business, says dan, and i was hoping to keep it in the family. you would be forgiven if the first question that comes to mind is who in his right mind would buy a used record store downloading and file - sharing, both legal and illicit, were a major concern of the gambles when they bought the store 15 years ago, and it s not like the problem went away. add netflix and other on - demand services to the mix and the entertainment pie is getting sliced, diced and spread around very thinly.yet after eight months behind the counter, meeting customers and learning how it all works, beaton says he s convinced his decision is sound, that there s a great opportunity to not only maintain the business, but build on it. boots on the ground is one thing that this place has always succeeded at, but there s this whole other phenomenon called social media that can take us much further. he s already given the store a presence on facebook, twitter and instagram, through which customers, many of them new, younger ones, can keep track of hard - to - find releases. he s also partnered with other businesses, such as the mod club dance party held sundays at babylon nightclub, to attract customers. for me it s all about engaging with the new generation, because it s obvious that there s a resurgence in vinyl. the renewed interest vinyl has been a two - headed phenomenon. a younger generation that grew up with cds and online digital file - sharing have discovered albums and have embraced their warmer sound and the very concept of an album, as opposed to ipod and mobile phone libraries set to shuffle. many oldsters, meanwhile, have hauled their turntables out of their attics and basements and are plugging them in. i ve listened to the white album at least 10,000 times on cd, says beaton, but you put the record on and the harmonies are a little bit different, the mixes are a little bit different. sonically, they re different, and it s worth re - collecting and re - listening to. the rebirth of vinyl has been a particular boon to stores such as the turning point, which devotes its second floor to vinyl and keeps many thousands more in storage on the third floor and in the basement, waiting for space on the retail shelves to open up. the increased popularity of vinyl came out of the blue, says dan. we re happy now that we never turned down people bringing in their old albums to sell. customers who are worried that beaton, more than 30 years gamble s junior, might fill the store s bins with teen pop music can relax. compare the pair s top - 5 desert - island lists; if dan is an original classic rock hippie, beaton is one at heart the albums on his list are, on average, 2.4 years older than those on gamble s neither, incidentally, chose an album released since the fall of the berlin wall . 1. rubber soul, the beatles 2. music from the big pink, the band 3. poetic champions compose, van morrison 4. blue, joni mitchell 5. live at leeds, the who 1. axis bold as love, the jimi hendrix experience 2. the dark side of the moon, pink floyd 3. abraxas, santana 4. after the gold rush, neil young 5. all things must pass, george harrison if you come into a shop like this, or any of our contemporaries, you re going to get discographies, says beaton. you re not just going to find steve miller s greatest hits, you re going to find his sailor record. we re going to have six or seven or 10 dylan records, and not just his hits. that s the heartbeat of this place, the catalogue and discographies. if you want something, yes, you can go to the internet, but you can also take a 10 -

2015-01-06,Ashby: Religion no excuse to mistreat transgendered people,"on december 28, 2014, a 17 - year - old girl by the name of leelah alcorn threw herself in front of an oncoming semi truck with the intent to end a lifetime of neglect and isolation at the hands of her parents. just days beforehand, she responded to what did you get for christmas this way on reddit some socks and some boy clothes. it sucks watching your sisters get dresses and having your family compliment how pretty they are when if i wore a dress i d get kicked out of the house. in her , leelah told the story of being a transgendered teen in christian america, raised by two parents who told her that her gender identity was a phase, and that god doesn t make mistakes. her parents refused to grant her the hormone therapy she requested at the age of 16, and then, when she said she was interested in boys, took her out of school and with her friends. leelah attributed her decision to kill herself directly to that approach, begging other parents of transgendered children please don t tell this to your kids. even if you are christian or are against transgender people don t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. that won t do anything but make them hate them self. that s exactly what it did to me. carla alcorn, the woman who gave birth to leelah, responded to her suicide on facebook by misgendering her and lying about the nature of her death. she later went on cnn , we don t support that, religiously, adding, we told him that we loved him unconditionally. mrs. alcorn keeps using that word. it doesn t mean what she thinks it means.in paul s first letter to the corinthians, he describes christian love this way love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. it does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. is often read at weddings. perhaps even the alcorns . it s a shame they didn t listen more carefully. and that they didn t listen to paul s third letter to the , wherein he says there is no longer jew or greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in christ jesus. or the part of gospel that places the needs of the soul above the pain of the body, or the stories tells of jesus choosing women at the fringes of society to reveal his message. there is no theological case for fighting any person s gender transition. the alcorns would have realized this, if they had dared to place the content of their bible above the sophistry of evangelical pundits.then again, listening was clearly not mr. and mrs. alcorn s strongest suit. had they listened, their daughter might still be alive. they might have learned that perceptions of gender predicted by the bed nucleus of the stria terminals of the human brain the same brain they believe god knew and knit in mrs. alcorn s womb jeremiah 1 5 - 10; psalm 139 13 . perhaps they have been waiting for god to open their ears and terrify them with warnings, as in . whatever warnings came, they obviously went just as unheard as their daughter s cries for help."
2015-01-06,PBO still can't get costs of Iraq mission,"three months after voting to undertake air strikes in iraq, the federal government still hasn t given a cost estimate for the mission to the parliamentary budget officer.it also won t say whether the figures will be contained in its response to a formal question posed in writing by an opposition mp.the budget officer, jean - denis fr chette, first asked the department of national defence for cost estimates on october 15. in the most recent exchange of letters, dnd told the watchdog to wait for the department s response to an order paper question posed by an mp.but a spokeswoman for the defence minister rob nicholson wouldn t say if the estimate will be disclosed when that question is answered in writing. in accordance with parliamentary privilege, responses to order paper questions cannot be released before they are tabled in the house of commons, johanna quinney wrote in an email. she said even disclosing whether the cost will be in the government s response would violate parliamentary privilege. we will report the actual costs for operation impact through existing parliamentary mechanisms, quinney added, declining to specify which mechanisms. operation impact is the name of canada s iraq mission. the government agreed on october 3 to join coalition air strikes against the islamic state isil . while other countries quickly provided cost estimates, the canadian government has been tight - lipped. defence officials they give the government regularly updated cost estimates. we have kind of a difficult relationship with dnd, said fr chette. it s a constant exchange of letters. in mid - november, then - deputy defence minister richard fadden saying the cost estimate fell under cabinet confidence information shared within the government to allow frank debate but not made public. aid data should not fall under the cabinet - confidence label, and that the government doesn t need confidentiality weeks after making decisions based on the data.in , fadden said dnd would provide the estimate, but not until it had been tabled in parliament in response to an order paper question. he also warned the estimate may be contained in a cabinet confidence. in a november 18 order paper question, ndp mp jack harris asked for the mission s estimated flying hours and cost estimates. with a 45 - calendar - day deadline, the government has until late january to respond in writing. it s a cynical act, said harris. it s just another example of this government s contempt for the role of the parliamentary budget office, in terms of assisting parliament. it s an office that they created with great fanfare as part of their supposed transparency in government, one that they ve continued to thwart at every step. fr chette had also asked dnd for its estimate of flight hours, noting this to media. fadden declined, saying only financial information falls under the pbo s mandate.nicholson his government will reveal the cost once the six - month mission ends, currently slated for april. the government could decide to extend the mission, which could further delay release of the figures.the you.s. government said last october its daily air strikes cost around 8.3 million. the australian government, which joined the mission just days before canada, said a year of fighting would cost about 500 million.using available data, last november that the first week of the mission cost canada between 8.1 million and 12.1 million.fr chette says his office regularly struggles to get any information from dnd in particular. it never ends. we don t give up, we just continue asking for the information.

2015-01-06,"Be our guest: Finnish conductor, John StorgÃ¥rds, joins NACO","for just the second time in its 45 - year history, the national arts centre has appointed a principal guest conductor for its resident orchestra.john storg rds, the finnish conductor who will lead naco in two concerts this week, was officially named to the post tuesday morning. he will formally assume his duties in september 2015. the three - year contract ensures that the 51 - year - old storg rds will be in ottawa for at least two weeks every season.the naco classical season is 17 subscription weeks long. the new music director, alexander shelley, will conduct a minimum of eight weeks and the rest of the time will be filled by other guest conductors. the contract leaves some flexibility to add something, storg rds said in an interview. although storg rds has recorded the entire sibelius symphony cycle, he does mix up his musical choices. i am very much a finn still. i feel at home there. i still wouldn t want to live anywhere else for a long period, said the conductor, noting that most of his education has been in his home country.the one time he did leave finland for education was when he went to israel to study the violin with the legendary player and educator haim taub. the conducting and new music, it has all been at home. i was involved in the foundation of the avanti ! chamber orchestra. this was one generation of people composers, conductors who all got together as teenagers and started to do something by ourselves, outside the establishment. that has meant a lot to us. in addition he is the artistic director of the lapland chamber orchestra, a post in finland s north that he has held since 1996 and intends to stay at, no matter what else happens in his busy international career.finnish music used to be all about the great composer jean sibelius 1865 - 1957 . i think things have changed quite a lot when you are talking about finland in the last 20 or 30 years, but before that finnish musical life was sibelius. everything else was in the shadow of sibelius, but it is not like that any more. now new finnish music is being played all over the world. being a small population, everybody in a certain field is always involved with everybody else. avanti ! was all about giving young finnish composers a chance to hear everything they wrote played, rehearsed and performed. today, he says, the established orchestras in finland include this kind of work in their programming.storg rds will be under contract for the next three years. the position is one that major orchestras try to fill. for example pinchas zukerman is the principal guest baton at the royal philharmonic orchestra in london.the nac also renewed the contracts of alain trudel as principal youth and family conductor and jack everly as principal pops conductor.storg rds first led naco in 2013 in an all - finnish program. in 2014 he conducted a performance of beethoven s eighth symphony.a violinist, storg rds has led the helsinki philharmonic orchestra as chief conductor since 2008. he helped found the avanti ! chamber orchestra. in 2011, storg rds was appointed principal guest conductor of the bbc philharmonic. he has made a number of international recordings, winning the cannes classical disc of the year award in 2004.this past year he has recorded a box set of sibelius symphonies with the bbc philharmonic on the chandos label.the other principal guest conductor of the naco was franz - paul decker from 1991 to 1999. decker, who led the montreal symphony orchestra for more than a decade, died last may. every artistic leadership has its own characteristics. if you look at the scope of goals that we the national arts centre orchestra have institutionally the promotion of new work being one goal and also the desire to hang on to a relationship with storg rds made the contract a natural development, deacon said.in the search for a replacement to pinchas zukerman as music director, the naco built a strong relationship with many potential successors, connections that the orchestra wishes to nurture. this guy was at the top of the list of people that we wanted to keep, deacon said.hiring decker made sense, deacon noted, because the music director at the time was trevor pinnock, a baroque specialist. decker s experience with brahms and beethoven made him a natural fit.this current contract is coming in a completely different set of circumstances, deacon says. this is to embrace the opportunity ahead of us with a change in leadership and to embrace good friends like john. naco is about to embark on a period of music that you have never heard before, and presenting music you do know in a different way, deacon says.that change in direction doesn t worry storg rds. it s very important to have a good relationship wioth the orchestra who see me as a many - sided musician. i don t want to be only the finnish guy focusing only on sibelius. i love to do that, but that s only one part of me. i love to work with orchestras that want to work with me in a lot of different repertoires. he says he feels that with the naco. there is a good hunger with this group, they want to work on things they know and they want to work on things they don t know. they have a disctinct personality that says we are here and ready. they are really together. on january 7 and 8 the ottawa audience will get a look at him as he leads naco in pieces by the dane carl nielsen little suite , a new work by american marc neikrug bassoon concerto featuring christopher millard and the german romantic robert schumann symphony no. 3 rhenish .after he is done in ottawa, storg rds is off to switzerland for a week and then back to finland. no doubt he will be hopping over to his job in britain with the bbc and make a foray into north america.it s a busy life. when he takes a break he likes to disappear into nature, just another reason why ottawa holds appeal."

2015-01-06,Heritage department paying for foreign photos to promote Canadian culture,"the department of canadian heritage is using stock photographs purchased from artists in russia, poland, denmark and the you.s. to decorate web pages about programs intended to promote canada s cultural industries.a search of images appearing on the department s site turned up numerous examples of pictures purchased online, without any apparent regard for using work created by canadian photographers or artists.the department s web page promoting its , for example, shows a group of young people in a movie theatre, wearing 3 - d glasses and eating popcorn. this picture is a by , a russian photographer based in moscow.another page promoting the which provides assistance to recording artists, features a picture of a crowd at a rock concert taken by , a german photographer specializing in concert and nightclub photography.a page about is topped by a group shot of young people looking at a smartphone and a tablet. it comes from a , who markets it with the prosaic title, young people sitting in a park with smart phones. even simple, generic images, such as pictures of a , were purchased through a stock photo agency from .the department commissions photographs from canadian photographers when time and budget allow and also maintains a collection of pictures, but there are times when our photobank does not contain a suitable image to illustrate a specific subject, spokesman len westerberg said in an email. in addition, the department has developed and maintains a photobank of images, from canadian sources; however, in those cases, the high cost of commissioning a photographer for a single, specific image cannot be justified. westerberg says the department uses a canadian - owned supplier of stock images, istock.com.in fact, the online stock agency, while founded by a canadian, has been owned by seattle - based getty images since 2002.while it is certainly cheaper and faster to buy royalty - free photographs rather than commissioning a photographer, the use of stock images in political or government communications has proved controversial in the past.in the 2014 ontario election campaign, tim hudak s progressive conservatives were forced to defend their use of stock footage of russian workers from chelyabinsk city in a video on his job creation plan, titled ontario working better. and in the 2008 federal election, the section on health care in the liberal party platform document used a stock picture of a senior citizen in a hospital bed that was taken in germany. in the same campaign, a conservative tv ad used a picture of a young california family walking on a beach to promote a child - care benefit. the couple, as it turned out, were democrats.other examples of stock photos used on the canadian heritage website include the page on canadian , which features an image of a man s hand holding a remote control in front of dozens of tv images. the picture is also , purchased from artur marciniec, a photographer in be chat w, poland. a photo of a woman dancing is the main image on a page promoting the . the picture is sold as a stock image by san francisco photographer tanya constantine. another page about the in the cultural industries is embellished with an image of a man drawing a bar chart that was created by a . the main photo on the , which gives financial assistance to magazines and journals, depicts a stack of magazines. it was shot by morten olsen.gmcgregor ottawacitizen.comtwitter.com glen mcgregor"
2015-01-06,Ottawa environmental doctor disciplined for treating suicidal teen with vitamins,"an ottawa doctor who treated a suicidal teenager with vitamins can only work with patients who have other doctors taking care of them, .the 19 - year - old woman died by suicide in spring 2011, after just a few months in dr. jennifer margaret armstrong s care.the woman first went to armstrong in december 2010, according to a college disciplinary finding released monday. she had a history of suicide attempts and hospitalizations, but her mother said she d improved with the help of a doctor experienced in environmental medicine.that isn t an officially recognized specialty in canada, but the mother hoped armstrong s work at the ottawa environmental health clinic, in a little building on carling avenue near andrew haydon park, would help her daughter.armstrong never did a standard mental - health assessment on her new patient, the disciplinary finding says. there were no conventional treatments offered or documented for her psychiatric symptoms, the disciplinary finding says. the patient was not treated for her psychiatric symptoms by another physician according to the chart. dr. armstrong did not refer this patient to another physician for the psychiatric symptoms or her seizures. the patient did not have a family physician. instead, dr. armstrong concentrated on giving vitamins, minerals and amino acids, which are not the standard of care. her focus regarding this patient was on chemical sensitivities and metal toxicities. armstrong admitted to not having upheld a proper standard of medical care for the young woman, the disciplinary finding says.the talks about helping people who ve been made sick by constant exposure to low doses of chemicals and energies in their environments, from mould to heavy metals to electromagnetic radiation. treatments include vitamin infusions, allergy tests and detoxification. many of those treatments aren t covered by public health insurance, and the site says patients can expect to pay between 500 and 2,000 out of pocket for the first month of armstrong s care. a vitamin infusion alone can cost up to 200.the voice mail at the clinic says patients who wear scents or smell of smoke won t be treated. it also says the clinic isn t taking new patients and its waiting list is closed.armstrong gets to keep her medical licence, but current patients, according to the disciplinary finding against armstrong, have until the end of january to find other doctors or armstrong has to stop treating them. those other doctors will have to get regular updates on what armstrong does with each patient, including new therapies she plans or changes to treatment she s already doing. there s no time limit on the condition.armstrong s registration with the college says she graduated from the university of toronto s medical school in 1977. the citizen has interviewed her in the past on environmental sensitivities she suffers from them herself, she said and the toxic effects of moulds. in 2011, a story said her clinic had a three - year waiting list.environmental medicine has a difficult history. its devotees point out that numerous substances have done damage to human health for a long time before they ve been widely recognized as dangerous pesticides, lead and cigarette smoke, for instance and argue that if we paid more attention to such factors, we d be healthier.critics, including many doctors, say sometimes there s no evidence that something is dangerous because it actually isn t dangerous, and trying to find environmental sources for particular afflictions can mean ignoring real problems."

2015-01-06,"Egan: Gangs who can't shoot straight, or a handful of idiots with guns?","is it possible we are, collectively, overreacting to the rash of shootings in the final weeks of 2014 put another way, could this be four or five idiots with rusty guns and terrible aim, as opposed to an all - out war between street gangs over money, drugs and turf the short answer is yes, says acting staff sgt. ken bryden of the ottawa police guns and gangs unit, though he would estimate the total number of shooters as, not four or five, but likely between 10 and 20. we re not experiencing a gang war by any stretch of the imagination. this might help explain, too, why chief charles bordeleau is not clanging the town bell or calling for the cavalry. he made clear to police reporter shaamini yogaretnam in a monday interview that the gang flare - up can be internally managed and does not require extraordinary measures, such as pleading for more funding.the shorthand no need to address city council, don t go startin no inquisition, just move along people, take a pill if need be.guns and bullets make for one of those panic, please - don t - panic situations and the language and record numbers being referenced are part of the dilemma with so - called framing a public policy discussion.we keep using 49 as a high point in the total number of fired - gun incidents last year. true, but this includes every shooting, including those not gang - related, like the national war memorial tragedy.gangs, however, accounted for about 85 per cent of the total. so, obviously that s a worry and when it hits a shopping mall, the needle is getting close to freakout red. in 2013, there were 30 shootings and in 2012 about 35. but the number of gang members is not dramatically up, nor the number of gangs, nor does there appear to be an all - out turf dispute. not to be underestimated, either, is the amount of stupid stuff that amounts to motive. this is a common theme in gang life.samples, from a you.s. police chief conference we have a bunch of disjointed neighbourhood gangs or affiliations usually first generation kids who practically shoot each other on sight. a lot of violent crime in philadelphia is due to stupid disputes that happen out on the street philadelphia police commissioner. and we have a lot of people affiliated with local crews and gangs who shoot each other because of what somebody said about them basically crews that behave rather immaturely wisconsin police chief. a lot of the fighting is about drugs, girls, and territory. but the majority of the violence involves young people, a lot of males between 14 and 18. they re not structured and they have no allegiance chicago police commander.staff sgt. bryden was asked whether stupid stuff accounts for some of ottawa s spike in numbers in 2014. yes, he said. we have incidents we re investigating now and it looks like the motivation is over a girl. oddly, showing disrespect in the gang world can be a major slight that, for fear of appearing weak, cannot be ignored by a rival. so, a retaliatory message might be sent, but with a bullet but only when an easy opportunity presents.back to numbers.a survey in 2002 found ottawa had 15 gangs and about 250 members. in 2012, the number of gangs was 15 to 19, with the total number at 485, but about two - thirds of those were considered associates. even the word gang is probably causing confusion. the police have a criteria, but the gang can have as few as three members. they can also be loosely affiliated, leading to phrases like hybrid gangs or even disorganized gangs. some of the gangs are even based in other cities. i hate using numbers, says staff sgt. bryden. and little wonder. this is not the kiwanis club, with a paid - up membership list. gang today, gone tomorrow.and this internal gang code you diss me, i shoot you obviously makes things more unpredictable in terms of so - called suppression. all the gathered intelligence, all the confidential informants in the world, won t alert police to the moment a gangbanger feels dishonoured and needs to lash out.staff sgt. bryden would not be the least bit surprised to see the 49 number drop into the more normal 30 range this year. i m not pushing any kind of buttons, either. we ve got the right people in here. we just had too much of it going on, right now. you only hope he s right. 2015 has rung in fairly quietly. silence is holdin ."

2015-01-06,"O'Toole has brief window to show that Tories care, say vets' advocates","the clock is ticking for new veterans affairs minister erin o toole to show the community he serves that significant changes are coming, say veterans advocates.o toole could face his first test january 30 when the government is expected to respond to a series of recommendations put forward by a commons committee on how to improve the lives of the country s former military personnel.the 14 recommendations from the commons standing committee on veterans affairs, issued june 2014, dealt with improvements to the controversial new veterans charter. those ranged from increasing the disability award provided to veterans to improving how injured soldiers are handled by the bureaucracy.veterans say that so far the conservative government has done little on the recommendations. that inactivity earned the government a rare public rebuke in october from the royal canadian legion. we need action now by the government, tom eagles, the legion s dominion president, said in an interview with the citizen tuesday.eagles said if the government acted on some of the commons committee s 14 recommendations, that would go a long way to help former soldiers such as those who fought in afghanistan.in addition, there is an opportunity with the upcoming federal budget for the government to show it is committed to providing more help for veterans, he added. we have to get something out of this coming federal budget and i m confident we are, eagles said.if that doesn t happen, it is unlikely any major changes would take place for another year because the government would be preparing for the upcoming election, he added.the new veterans charter altered the way that injured military personnel are compensated. under the charter, veterans are offered a lump - sum payment instead of a pension for life. that, say current veterans, means they receive much less over their lifetime than those who fought in previous wars.veterans advocate don leonardo noted that since 2010 there have been a large number of reports issued from the veterans ombudsman to the commons committee on the problems that need to be fixed. the problems are very well known and have been for years, so the time for study is over, said leonardo, founder of veterans canada. this is an election year and o toole has a very short window to make some significant changes. leonardo said acting on all of the 14 recommendations from the commons committee would go a long way to rebuilding the trust the conservative government has lost with veterans.prime minister stephen harper has portrayed his government as a strong supporter of those who fought. government ministers insist veterans under the conservatives have never had it so good.but that hasn t stopped a groundswell of protest from veterans who counter that the conservatives are in fact rolling back benefits. former military personnel have been angered over cuts in services, closures of veterans affairs offices, and delays in receiving benefits.former veterans affairs minister julian fantino became the lightning rod for that anger after a series of high - profile public relations disasters, including verbal sparring with elderly veterans in front of tv cameras.but fantino s supporters, as well as veterans advocates, have pointed out that the minister was only the messenger he was, in fact, implementing conservative government policy.some such as former veterans ombudsman pat stogran have portrayed o toole s appointment as political window dressing. there s a reason why o toole just received the post it s because he has no qualms going public with the party line, which i would say is hugely disingenuous, stogran told the citizen.it appears that o toole was already being groomed for the veterans affairs job in mid - december when he, and not fantino, was offered up by the conservatives for media interviews on veterans issues.during those interviews o toole defended the conservative s track record on veterans issues. he, like fantino, suggested that the government needs to communicate better on what it provides to veterans, particularly those who have returned from afghanistan.there are two other areas that have caused much anger against the conservative government from veterans. one is the closure of veterans affairs offices across the country, which prompted protests at some of the sites.eagles said he could see o toole re - examining the decisions behind the closures but stopped short of predicting that anything would be reversed. other veterans say it is highly doubtful that o toole would reverse those closures since the government has so strenuously defended its decision to shut down the offices.the other high - profile issue for o toole is an ongoing class - action lawsuit by injured afghan veterans over the benefits offered under the new veterans charter.the government s lawyers have argued in that case that canada does not have a social contract to take care of its veterans. for decades, veterans had assumed that canada had the legal and social responsibility to take care of its former soldiers.the move by the government to deny such a responsibility exists is a significant departure, say veterans who don t expect the conservatives to back down from that position in court.veterans ombudsman guy parent has recommended that the social contract be made part of changes to the new veterans charter."

2015-01-07,Ontario craft brewers balk at Beer Store offer,"a surprise decision from the beer store to open up its corporate ownership and adopt more craft beer - friendly selling practices is being met with mixed reviews from small beer makers who say the announcement raises more questions than answers.the beer store tbs , formerly known as brewers retail, announced a plan on wednesday to create three new seats on its board of directors and allow ontario craft breweries to buy shares in tbs, becoming co - owners of the chain.tbs said the decision came after extensive consultations with the province s booming craft beer industry.the company is offering to sell a single class e share for 1,000 to new breweries producing more than five million litres of beer a year, or a class f share for 100 to breweries producing a smaller volume. tbs would not comment on the number of total shares it has outstanding.with those shares the microbrewers will be eligible for one of three new seats on tbs s board of directors. however, the board will maintain five seats for molson coors. another five seats have been set aside for labatt brewing company, which is owned by anheuser - busch inbev, the same company that manufacturers beer under the budweiser brand. an additional two seats will be held for sleeman brewery ltd., owned by japanese beer giant sapporo. it will be a big share, a governance share, entitling them to be represented on the board, he said. we did it this way to allow small brewers to become owners without large capital costs some could not afford. however, being on the board is no guarantee that your voice will be heard, says a professor of finance at the ivey school of business at western university.premier kathleen wynne has suggested that tbs could be forced to pay the government franchise fees to continue operating in ontario. in april, ed clark was appointed to lead the premier s advisory council on government assets, which is examining ways to boost the province s cash flow.susie heath, a spokeswoman for the minister of finance charles sousa, said wednesday that tbs s sudden announcement will be a part of the council s review.steve beauchesne, co - owner of beau s brewing co. in vankleek hill, is skeptical about the tbs announcement. i ve got more questions than i do opinions, he said, adding that tbs did not consult microbrewers on the changes. it s certainly better than nothing at all. it s interesting that we ve had no communication whatsoever from the beer store for the longest time. beauchesne said the deal lowers but does not remove some barriers that microbrewers have complained about. for example, tbs is offering to stock two products on the shelves of five stores that are, geographically, closest to the brewery. he said for a rural brewery like his, which already ships to dozens of tbs shops across the province, having access to five small stores in towns like hawkesbury isn t much benefit.similarly, brewers in downtown locations would see their beer appear on tbs shelves in their immediate vicinity, which would cut into more profitable sales at the breweries themselves.the announcement was panned by ontario craft brewers, an association of 50 microbrewers who have been lobbying for change in the way the province sells alcohol. our goal continues to be fundamental change to ontario s beer distribution channels that will result in a doubling or tripling of the jobs currently created by the craft brewers as well as the ability to reach our full share of market potential, said cam heaps, chairman of ontario craft brewers, in a statement. it certainly does not address our major issue of improving access for consumers.

2015-01-07,Charles Bordeleau: How the Ottawa police are responding to gang violence,"we live in a safe city. however, as police, we recognize that there are fluctuations in crime to which we must be prepared to respond.while reported crime is down, there has been an increase in targeted, street gang - related shootings. these incidents have taken place across the city, in various neighbourhoods, and with the common linkage being the illegal drug trade, the availability of hand guns, and the increased willingness of street gang members to use them.i recognize the concern in the community about these shootings. there is always a threat that these targeted shootings can result in an innocent person being struck.preventing this activity, arresting the individuals responsible, and ensuring they are held accountable by the court system continues to be a top operational priority of the ottawa police.but while the focus of the ottawa police is squarely on enforcement and proactive policing, we know that the solutions to this issue rest with the community at large. those longer - term solutions include continued and increased police focus but also increased focus from community agencies who can assist in steering people away from, or out of, the gang lifestyle.we are responding to these incidents with an increased enforcement strategy that will hold offenders accountable. we have doubled the number of investigators in our guns and gangs unit and we have members in patrol, districts, and the drug unit focused on investigating, identifying, charging, and keeping close tabs on known gang associates and prolific offenders.i am confident in the officers working to deal with this increase. they have been doing excellent work on this issue. in 2014 alone, 83 gang members and associates were arrested with hundreds of charges laid.more than 50 crime guns were seized by ottawa police in 2014 and more than half of those were handguns. according to provincial statistics, about 60 per cent of crime guns in ontario are foreign - sourced and smuggled into canada often originating in the united states. about 20 per cent are domestically sourced and another 20 per cent have no known origin.even after individuals are charged, our police work is often not done. in cases where individuals have been released on court conditions, our direct action response team officers conduct hundreds of compliance checks to ensure they are keeping to those conditions. in 2014, 29 street gang members or associates were found in breach of conditions and arrested.about two years ago, we began a discussion on a city - wide gang strategy that includes enforcement but also supports and help for individuals and families vulnerable to the gang lifestyle.through our partnerships with crime prevention ottawa, we are supporting the ottawa gang strategy which is designed to help prevent or curtail future gang membership. for example, we are working with the children s aid society and community partners like the john howard society and you turn to reach out to younger siblings of gang involved youth to break the cycle of violence in families.the youth services bureau is building a trades centre to offer training, employment possibilities and hope to youth involved with the law who are currently making money illegally but need new, realistic sources of income.there have been hundreds of people involved in information sessions and relationship building exercises to develop a more positive understanding between the criminal justice system and immigrant communities.we are also looking at ways to address gaps in supports such as the need for support for offenders who come out of jail with the gang lifestyle as their only perceived option.a great amount of work still needs to be done and our officers are committed to the task of protecting community safety."
2015-01-07,"The doctor is in: Kathleen Pajer, CHEO's chief psychiatrist","dr. kathleen pajer took over as chief of psychiatry at the children s hospital of eastern ontario last sept. 27. her other title is so long she had to go look on her office door to describe it chief of the regional child and youth specialty psychiatric and mental health services.pajer was born in san antonio, texas her father was in the you.s. air force but grew up in a connecticut beach town near new london. she studied special education at university of connecticut before doing her medical degree at the university of south alabama. she did her residency at dartmouth college, specializing in adolescent psychiatry, and later added a masters in public health from yale, where she had a fellowship in clinical epidemiology. she came to canada in 2011, where she was chief of psychiatry at the iwk health centre in halifax.she is 62, married, and the mother of five adult children. her husband is pediatric health services researcher. i was happy at iwk, but cheo was appealing for several reasons. the entire hospital is being transformed under alex munter with the goal of evidence - based care and continuous quality improvement. that s something i had been working on at the iwk and was looking for in my job search. alex already had that well underway here. the other reason is the scholarly environment at cheo. the value to clinical system change of having lots of research going on right next door can t be underestimated. my husband and i saw the potential here for being able to create a focus for services research that would feed clinical change and vice versa. the system works on a pyramid. at the bottom are primary caregivers family doctors and general pediatricians. next come secondary caregivers, such as psychiatrists and specialized agencies like youth services bureau. at the top are the tertiary caregivers the highly trained mental health specialists at cheo and the royal. what s going wrong here is there are a bunch of tertiary care providers concentrated in one place. and there s not enough primary and secondary care providers. the pyramid is unbalanced, pajer said. people can t flow up and down the pyramid like they re supposed to. so the schools and youth detention, for example, are stuck with kids who have problems. they have trouble finding people to see them and since the tertiary care people are concentrated with us, people line up outside our door. let s call them 0pportunities for improvement , rather than problems to be fixed , pajer said. access can be improved. movement through our system could be improved more effective, more rapidly given care. we can empower families and kids to take care of themselves. and we as tertiary care providers can share our knowledge and expertise with our partners in the community and our primary care physician partners. if i take it from a parent or a youth perspective and that s the only one that counts all they know is their kid is having trouble and they can t find any help. they knock on any door they can find. they go to their family doctor or a walk - in clinic and they wait and they wait until their kids gets so bad that they bring them to an emergency room. once you get in the door, there s another wait - list a hidden wait - list and that s for actual treatment. at iwk we d have someone come in to the emergency room and say, i m not leaving with my child. get protective services involved . what s needed, pajer said, is a way to move patients up and down the pyramid as their needs change. when a wait list begins, if that is not constantly managed if you don t assess to people to see if they still belong on the wait list, or if they need to be on the wait list at all then the list just grows and grows. you don t know if they need it. you don t know if they re getting worse. they just sit there without services. involving secondary care providers and empowering families and patients with information and resources allows them to take better care of themselves, she said. doing a better job at identifying specific goals for treatment can also make it easier to discharge patients and open up space for new patients, she said. there s a very artificial boundary between the pediatric world and the adult world. in fact, children s brains don t stop developing until they re about 23. so we ve got a big problem with even the average mental health patient. it s even worse with the developmentally delayed youth because their cognitive function is way behind even their physical function. they move into the adult world and those care providers have no training. those kids fall through the cracks. what we really need are epidemiological data. one of the groundbreaking studies was done in 1987, and that s been the gold standard for many, many years for what the needs are for child and adolescents with regards to mental health, so it s obviously outdated. but if i was just going to look at what i ve seen across mental health, i would say it s polarized. there s a group of kids who are extremely competent, really functional and mature all along the way. but there s a bigger group and they re the ones we end up seeing who just don t seem to have built the resilience to cope with the vicissitudes of adolescent life, including romantic breakups, problems in school, with peers, not getting good grades, not being able to find jobs those sorts of things throw them completely for a loop, so they engage in maladaptive strategies, such as cutting themselves, hurting themselves, even killing themselves. pajer doesn t mince words on the effects of marijuana on adolescents. there s a huge group of kids who are smoking weed every day and think that it s perfectly ok and doesn t affect their brains at all, she said. sometimes even parents think it doesn t affect their brains. but it does. we now know that it markedly decreases motivation and markedly decreases memory. these things also contribute to your inability to cope with a situation that s causing you stress. that s a factor that people don t want to hear, but marijuana smoking is not benign. cheo and the royal are looking for public input as they prepare a new strategic plan to deal with youth mental health issues. you can contribute by filling out ."
2015-01-07,Randall Denley: Ottawa's policing dilemma,"does ottawa have enough police officers, or not if you ottawa police association president matt skof, ottawa is 189 officers short. that s alarming, if true. he cites a study by the fraser institute to back up his contention. police chief charles bordeleau says the 1,334 officers he has now are enough to handle problems like the current surge in gang - related shooting.skof s argument is simplistic and misleading, but the city is locked into a path where it will never be able to afford more officers. that can t be right, either.skof s main point is that the number of police should increase as the population increases, and that hasn t been happening. but it s not population alone that drives a need for policing. it s the crime rate and the number of calls the public makes to the police. calls for service have declined by more than nine per cent between 2011 and 2013. the crime rate declined by 10 per cent between 2012 and 2013.why would we need more police officers, when there is less demand for their services skof also twists the real point of the fraser institute report. it is a national study of police efficiency, which it measures by the number of police officers per 100,000 population. far from recommending more cops for ottawa, the conservative think tank cites our town as an example of efficiency because we have fewer police than it would have anticipated. other cities should follow our lead, the institute suggests.there is a valid issue here, though. eventually, ottawa will need more police officers and we need a rational way to determine when that is.the fraser institute looked at crime rates, income and socio - demographic factors in its effort to estimate how many police cities should have. it concluded that 60 per cent of the variation in police numbers couldn t be explained by any rational factor. the short answer is, every city has the number of police its leaders think are required and the public is willing to pay for.ottawa, like other canadian cities, is caught in a squeeze where taxpayers have to pay big annual increases for policing, but get no additional service.despite a two - per - cent tax increase limit, the police budget is actually going up 3.5 per cent this year. that s about 8 million.a former ottawa mayor, in his wisdom, decided that the police tax should be a separate item, so that councillors couldn t be blamed for rising police costs. as a result, police automatically get a share of new city tax dollars generated by growth. this year, that means a 1.75 per cent growth - related budget increase for the police. the city is giving the police another 1.75 per cent on top of that, which is the tax increase you actually hear about.despite similar increases every year since 2011, the ottawa police have not been able to afford to hire even one additional officer.arbitrated salary increases are eating up all the money taxpayers are throwing at policing. police got a 2.5 per cent raise each year for 2013 and 2014, and raises of 2.99 and 2.95 per cent the two years before that. the salary for a first - class constable is now 90,244.even with the large budget increases the police have been getting, ottawa will not be able to afford any new officers for the next four years without breaking mayor jim watson s tax promise. salary increases will continue to consume all the money the police get.what s the long game for the city are we going to hire more officers when we need them, or are we going to keep the number static to help council hit a magic budget target i believe bordeleau when he says we have enough police officers for now, but we re going to have to hire some eventually. it s not too soon to start putting together a rational plan for why we need them, and how we re going to pay for them."
2015-01-07,North Bay pounds Ottawa 67's in makeup game,"in just the last eight days since trading resumed in the ontario hockey league, there has been 10 trades involving 19 players and an amazing 29 future draft picks, some as far away as 2020.as the trade deadline of noon, friday fast approaches, pat higgins is continually checking his cell phone for calls, hoping to get in on the action.the rookie general manager of the ottawa 67 s is trying to put a deal or two together that won t hurt his playoff - bound club in the short - term while strengthening the team going forward in 2015 - 16. and that s no easy task.his quest might have gotten a bit more urgent after the 67 s played their second to last game before the deadline tuesday night, dropping a 6 - 3 decision to the north bay battalion before a sparse crowd at td place. this was a makeup game postponed from november 9 because of a malfunction in the ice plant at bank street. we have two or three irons in the fire, said higgins. realistically, we re not in a position to win a memorial cup and that s where every team wants to get. at the same time, our goal has always been to get our young nucleus some playoff experience we owe it to them to learn about what it takes to win at that time of the year. it is a different time. so it s got to be a deal that keeps us competitive this year and strengthens us moving forward. the battalion are swinging for the fences this season, loading up with ohl veterans ryan kujawinski and nick moutrey in recent days while mortgaging some of their future in parting with draft picks.that new muscle showed as north bay, without senators prospect nick paul, jumped to a 5 - 0 lead that included back - to - back short - handed goals in the second period.in a perfect world, higgins would take calls on just about any of his 19 - year - olds.the 67 s have five on defence and four up front and they will only be able to keep three next year has over - agers.he might also entertain offers for his current overagers from a team loading up for a long playoff run.the sault ste. marie greyhounds and barrie colts both fall into that category while some of the teams near the bottom of the standings are looking to dump veterans.the 67 s fall somewhere in between. we can t go three years without making the playoffs and expect to recruit high - end kids, said higgins, of the 67 s who last played a playoff game in the spring of 2012. so if a team offers the right body, by that i mean a guy who can play for us right now and down the road, great. if not, i would want picks in return. owen green, kujawinski, mike baird, mike amodeo, ray huether and mountrey scored for the battalion.dante salituro, with his 26th, sam studnicka and brendan bell replied for the 67 s, who are in peterborough thursday night before returning home for games friday and sunday. we played like a bunch of guys looking for a deal, said 67 s coach jeff brown. sometimes that happens to a team at the deadline. this was a huge step backwards for us. i m embarrassed. this reflects on me. twitter.com ottawa dc"

2015-01-07,U.S. training of Syrian rebels could begin by early spring,"the long - awaited coalition program to train the syrian moderate opposition could begin by early spring, and officials are beginning to identify individual fighters who could participate, the writes.here is the rest of the article navy rear adm. john kirby, pentagon press secretary, also said for the first time that the you.s. military is conducting several investigations into reported civilian casualties that may have occurred in the you.s. - led coalition airstrikes against islamic state militants. he said he had no additional information on the incidents, but military leaders said earlier that they were unaware of any civilian deaths resulting from the bombings.the effort to train syrian rebels is part of the overall campaign to defeat the islamic state militants who seized large swaths of syria and iraq. kirby said that once the training program gets up and running it may require additional you.s. forces to assist with the instruction. he did not provide details on how many. turkey, qatar and saudi arabia have agreed to provide training locations.the you.s. is involved in a plan to train both moderate syria rebels and to train and assist iraqi security forces in order to beat back the islamic state militants rampage in both countries.kirby said is momentum in iraq has stalled and is fighters have largely been in a defensive posture for several weeks. whatever momentum they had been enjoying has been halted, has been blunted. that has stayed steady over the last couple of weeks, kirby said. it s very much a contested environment, but what we don t see, what we haven t seen in the last several weeks has been any renewed offensive moves. he added that there are still a number of areas controlled or threatened by the is group, including mosul and parts of anbar province in iraq and portions of northern syria, including kobani.you.s. forces have been flowing into iraq to conduct training. about 170 troops from the 1st infantry division began training iraqi forces in late december at taji, north of baghdad. and there are about 320 you.s. troops at al - asad air base in western iraq, training members of the iraqi army s 7th division. those you.s. troops are mostly marines and they started the training on december 20.as of this week, there are about 2,140 you.s. troops in iraq to train, advise and assist the iraqis and provide security for the american forces. president barack obama has authorized the deployment of a total of 3,000 you.s. troops to iraq, and kirby said the remainder of that force should arrive in the country in the next four to six weeks.on the civilian casualties, kirby referred reporters to central command for details such as the number of alleged deaths and when they came to central command s attention. officials at central command said they were unable to immediately provide answers but were preparing a statement with further details.as recently as last month, lt. gen. james l. terry, the top commander of the coalition that is fighting the islamic state in iraq and syria, told reporters at a pentagon news conference that his organization is extremely careful and deliberate about its targeting. we have some great capability in terms of precision, terry said, speaking of airstrikes in iraq and efforts to avoid hitting either civilians or friendly iraqi forces. to date, we ve got a very good record. i am tracking no civilian casualties.

2015-01-07,Winter's first big chill arrives: Now it's serious,"brace for it. the first serious cold snap of the winter you have to take 35 c seriously descended on the ottawa valley late tuesday and looks set to linger for at least all of wednesday.the situation prompted environment canada to issue an extreme cold warning that includes very cold wind chills for the national capital region on wednesday. a cold front is crossing southern ontario this morning, the federal agency said wednesday morning in its warning. very cold temperatures in the wake of this front, combined with moderate winds, will result in wind chill values near or below 35 c this afternoon and tonight. according to opp, the cold weather made for slick road conditions wednesday and caused at least 12 accidents along highways in the city.police responded to several collisions, including three multiple - vehicle accidents near the eagleson road offramp of highway 417, which led to massive traffic pileups on area roads during the morning rush hour.forecasters say tonight will be the coldest night since the winter of 2012 - 2013. while last winter was long, unrelenting and colder that average, ottawa didn t have a single night that reached 30 c.extreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill create an elevated risk to health, such as frostbite and hypothermia. a forecast windchill factor of 35 c or lower can trigger these warnings. under such conditions, exposed skin can freeze in less than 10 minutes.with the warning comes some essential advice dress warmly. those who work outside, live in poorly insulated homes, or lack heat and power, suffer medical conditions such as diabetes and peripheral neuropathy that affect the blood vessels, or take medications that include beta - blockers, and the homeless, all are at greater risk of frostbite and hypothermia than others.winter sports enthusiasts and those who drink alcohol in excess are also at risk, along with infants and seniors.if you have to go outdoors you re advised to dress in layers with a wind resistant outer layer. synthetic and wool fabrics provide better insulation.you can remove layers if you get too warm or start perspiring or add a layer if you get cold. if you get wet, change into dry clothing as soon as possible. you lose heat faster when you re wet.the cold began settling into the ottawa valley early tuesday, albeit with large variations in temperatures among cities and towns not necessarily far apart.at 8 a.m., for example, environment canada reported it was 25.4 c in gatineau, 20.5 c just across the river in ottawa, and 15.8 c in kemptville. renfrew was 25.9 c. brockville basked at 13.4 c.the temperature variations illustrated a feature of the ottawa valley that can show up in cold, still air the coldest air settles in the bottom of the valley.gatineau, where the weather station measures temperatures down near the river, generally shows up as colder in such conditions than does ottawa, which gets measurements on higher ground at the ottawa international airport.wherever it s measured, however, it s undeniably chilly, and ottawa public health joined environment canada in issuing warnings about the potential for frostbite over the next few days.of course, we aren t the only things to feel the snap of cold. the earth itself seems to, well, shiver on occasion. indeed, there have been scattered reports over the last couple of days of frostquakes. that sounds scarier that it is. frostquakes the fancy name is cryoseism, and, no, that isn t a typo occur when ground saturated with water freezes, and the expansion of water as it becomes ice makes stress build up in the ground. when the stress gets too high it releases like a mini - earthquake, but with no destructive power.it can, however, make a loud bang. a facebook page run by a group of neighbours in stittsville collected dozens of reactions from people who heard one or more bangs starting about 3 a.m. on monday. some reported seeing the floor vibrate.one wrote this woke me up but not my husband or the kids, a big bang and i swear i felt the house shake ! told my husband when the baby woke him up later i hadn t been back to sleep yet and he went to have a look around. i thought someone drove into the house ! whether it s the earth shivering or you, there is, perhaps, some cold comfort in the knowledge that the rest of ontario, along with quebec and the southern parts manitoba and saskatchewan have also received extreme cold alerts. ditto for much of labrador.in fact, prairie residents might be worse off than we are. winds of 20 - 30 km h combined with temperatures near 30 c created wind chill values of 40 c or lower in regina and saskatoon as well as brandon and dauphin.as for the rest of the country, much of british columbia interior was enduring winter storms or heavy snowfall, the northwest territories and nunavut enjoy blizzard conditions, and the yukon is under a heavy snowfall warning.welcome to the great white north except for victoria and vancouver where temperatures were a balmy 9 c under partly cloudy skies ."

2015-01-07,Hepatitis C treatments are 'history in the making' at a high cost,"billybob mcpherson lived on ottawa s streets as a young teenager before running away with the carnival. the 55 - year - old doesn t know exactly when during his colourful life he contracted hepatitis c he thinks it might have been in texas in the 1980s where he had surgery and blood transfusions while working as a carny.but without treatment, he believes, the disease would have ended his life.today, he is disease free, a living testament to the wonders of new drugs developed to cure the liver disease with few or no side effects. but he is also an example of the painful realities of the new treatments.mcpherson was cured because he took part in a clinical trial of the drug holkira pak, which was approved by health canada late last month. for 12 weeks he took nine pills a day, suffered no side - effects, and almost immediately began to feel better, he said. these guys saved my life, he says of the pharmaceutical company abbvie, which developed the treatment and has held clinical trials in ottawa, throughout canada, and around the world.but without the benefit of the clinical trial, mcpherson, who lives on a disability pension, would not have been able to afford the cure.it is a reality dr. curtis cooper, director of the ottawa hospital and regional hepatitis program, who oversaw the abbvie trials, deals with daily.holkira pak, which had a 97 - per - cent cure rate in clinical trials, including for patients with cirrhosis, is not yet on the market, and its price is not public. but other new drug regimes that treat and cure hepatitis c genotype 1 without using interferon which causes difficult side effects and is less effective , are priced well out of the range of most patients.for example, gilead s sofosbuvir drug, known as sovaldi, costs 55,000 in canada for a 12 - week course of treatment, according to the company. treatment costs to patients can be considerably higher, though, since often costly drugs are combined. one local patient with genotype 2 hepatitis c said he was told this week a combination of drugs, including sofosbuvir, taken over 16 weeks would cost 100,000.the man is waiting to hear whether his insurance, or the drug company would cover part or all of the cost. if not, he said, he will pay for it himself. it is literally a life - and - death situation for me. at the end of the day, it is more important to have the drug than to be worrying about the price. health canada has approved three new drugs, sofosbuvir, simeprevir and harvoni since late 2013. holkira pak was approved by health canada on december 22, about the same time it received approval from the you.s. federal drug administration.dr. jordan feld, a hepatologist at the francis family liver clinic at toronto western hospital, called the development of new therapies for hepatitis c history in the making. hepatitis c is a devastating disease that causes more years of life lost than any infectious disease in the country. with the introduction of life - saving therapies that offer high cure rates, we can finally prevent complications of the disease and it actually raises the possibility that we even eliminate the disease from canada altogether. but neither the ontario drug plan nor many private plans cover the cost of the drugs, although simeprevir is covered under the province s exceptional access program, for some patients who meet defined criteria. abbvie and other companies also provide drugs to some patients on a compassionate basis.still, cooper said he sees patients almost on a daily basis who can t afford the cure. it is very hard to explain to a patient that we have these great new treatment but i can t put you on them because they are not paid for. of 5,000 patients at the ottawa hospital clinic with hepatitis c, 100 of them are taking one of the new treatments. some of those patients are covered by insurance that pays, or partly pays, for the treatment, said cooper. others receive treatment at no cost because of their circumstances and condition. some patients, like mcpherson, have benefitted from clinical trials of the drugs. a few have paid for the drugs out of their pockets.government funding for the drugs might come too late to save the lives of some patients who could be saved now, said cooper. if you have a patient who already has cirrhosis, it is really tough for them to understand they could die in the next year without getting this therapy that is health canada approved. cooper believes ontario, which he says has been reviewing some of the drugs for months, should immediately begin paying for treatment of patients with advanced liver disease.hepatitis c patients have high rates of poverty, substance abuse and mental health issues a demographic with little power. the virus, which affects 170 million people around the world, can scar the liver and lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. deaths are on the rise and baby boomers are considered most at risk. according to one report, two - thirds of the people with the virus are in that age group, and a large proportion is unaware of it.cooper noted there are limited health budgets to pay for drugs, but he said the cost of paying health providers to care for hepatitis c patients year after year is also high, as is the cost of a liver transplant between 200,00 or 300,000 for those lucky enough to get one.mcpherson knows he was lucky to get into the abbvie drug trial. he was diagnosed with hepatitis c in the past few years but believes he had it for some time. his illness was at stage 3, but mcpherson says he was well on his way to stage 4 and needing a liver transplant.before being diagnosed, mcpherson, who had long since quit drinking, said he felt like he had a permanent hangover. i knew something was wrong. that feeling went away soon after he began taking the drug regime in nine pills a day. within two weeks of starting the trial, he said, his viral load was at zero. it is really remarkable.

2015-01-07,Preferred O-Train extension includes airport link,"it appears a rail link to ottawa s international airport, once dismissed by city officials, might be in the cards after all.as part of its ongoing environmental assessment ea study on plans to extend o - train service from greenboro station to riverside south, the city is expected to unveil next week a preferred option that includes a new spur to the macdonald - cartier international airport and the ey centre. what we re doing here is we re getting the ea approval for that, but the decision as to when we re actually going to build it and implement it is a separate item, said colin simpson, the city s senior project manager of transportation planning.extending the o - train s trillium line is part of the ambitious second phase of light rail construction a 3 - billion plan that would also see service extended east, west and south to place d orl ans, bayshore shopping centre and algonquin college by 2023.it s unclear just how much the airport link would cost, simpson said. the estimated price tag of the o - train extension from greenboro to bowesville road in riverside south is about 100 million.an earlier incarnation of the plan had the airport spur travelling south of alert road, near the hilton gardens hotel, but simpson said the proposed alignment has now changed to travel north of the ey centre, which would also be served by a station.the preferred station location at the airport is between the terminal building and the parking garage. it would come around on a big sweeping curve on an elevated platform and it would rise up to the third floor of the parking garage, simpson said.the ottawa international airport authority was quick to welcome the development. we re obviously very much in support of a link to the airport, said vice - president krista kealey.without knowing the estimated cost of the spur, kealey said, it was premature to discuss what, if any, contribution the airport authority would make. we re looking forward to moving the project forward and being there with them, she said.the proposed plan envisions what simpson called a dual overlay, which means service would be provided to meet the demands at a given time.during peak hours, trains would primarily serve riverside south with every second or third train going to the airport; during off - peak hours, such as during the day and in the evening, that would be flipped, so most of the trains would go to the airport and fewer trains would go to riverside south, he said.that the city s transportation planners are including a spur to the airport as part of the preferred option is a noteworthy development.a 2013 report had ruled out such a spur and instead called for upgraded service on the 97 bus.but that didn t sit well with airport management and, by the end of november, a compromise to include exploring a link to the airport as part of the ea was reached.this is one of three environmental assessments being undertaken as part of phase 2, which could add as many as 19 new stations and 35 kilometres to the lrt network.the study area includes the existing trillium line corridor, between bayview and greenboro stations, the walkley yard maintenance and storage facility, and the proposed southern extension.the feasibility of new stations at gladstone avenue north side and walkley road south side are also part of the current study.residents can learn more at two open houses scheduled for next week; the first is at the jim durrell recreation centre 1265 walkley rd. on january 13 from 6 to 8 p.m. and the second is two nights later at st. anthony s banquet hall 423 st. anthony st. from 6 to 8 p.m.the finalized staff recommendations for the o - train extension will be presented to the transportation committee in june."
2015-01-07,City officials to study safety concerns raised over Airport Parkway Bridge,"concerns about safety and insufficient lighting have prompted city officials to revisit the airport parkway bridge, just six weeks after the much - maligned crossing opened.river coun. riley brockington was joined tuesday by his gloucester - southgate colleague coun. diane deans and officials from a range of departments including ottawa police, oc transpo and public works to discuss concerns about a lack of lighting on the pathways on the east side of the bridge, adjacent to south keys station, where some have reported people loitering.insufficient snow clearing and icy conditions on the ramps were also raised at the meeting. the bridge is a very good addition to the city, a very good connector, but there are certainly some operational and safety issues that need to be addressed, brockington said wednesday.during the meeting, city officials agreed to conduct a pair of safety audits one in the winter to address immediate concerns and another in the spring, to examine sight - line issues once all the foliage has grown in.brockington said he wants members of the public particularly those who regularly use the bridge or who would use the bridge to be involved in the audits, so the concerns of the community are heard and can be addressed.the councillor, who was elected to his first term in october, says he s already hearing from residents who say they don t feel safe using the bridge. people should feel safe in their community and when they re not, i want to know why and what we can do to address that, he said.some have called for video surveillance, but brockington says that could create a false sense of security because there is no one to monitor the footage around the clock.the bridge, which was years behind schedule and over - budget when it opened november 29, is close to where the body of tausif chowdhury, an international student at carleton university, was discovered days earlier.the 23 - year - old was beaten to death and found by two cyclists on the sawmill creek pathway, which surrounds the reservoir of the same name and lies between south keys station and the new pedestrian bridge.two men have been arrested and jointly charged with one count of manslaughter and one count of robbery in connection with chowdhury s death.brockington said oc transpo confirmed during the meeting that its constables conduct foot patrols of the station and haven t reported a rise in suspicious activity of late. but it s not oc transpo s responsibility to monitor beyond the tunnel that connects the transit station with the pathway.police have agreed to increase patrols in the area, but brockington said he acknowledges that officers can t be posted there 24 7.the potential cost of addressing the concerns won t be clear until after the safety audits are conducted. i think this is a small investment with big payoff, brockington said."

2015-01-07,Aisha Sherazi: The true offence to the prophet Muhammed,"wednesday was a difficult day for france, most of all for those families whose loved ones were killed in a horrific attack on the magazine charlie hebdo. in a lesser way, it was difficult for all of us. it was difficult for those of us in ottawa who haven t forgotten the confusion, shock, concern and fear of a terror attack. it s difficult for the muslim community, who fear that once again, a few senseless individuals will have used islam as a scapegoat, to vent frustrations and ignorance.all of us keep asking, why we seem to get no logical response to that question.there are some questions, as a muslim, i understand the answer to.for example, why is it painful to the muslim community if the prophet muhammed peace be upon him is depicted in a negative light it is painful to a muslim because the prophet is a role model. he is like a second father, a brother, a leader, a teacher and friend. we believe he received revelation from god in a cave more than 1,400 years ago, yet the message and his values hold true to us today.so, when attacks like the one in paris occur, i ponder, what would the prophet himself make of them would he agree that he has been avenged of course, when a person has left this world, we cannot ask them directly. to a certain extent, we can only ask historians and scholars, and rely on storytellers to give us the answer.it is said that the prophet muhammed never took revenge for any personal injury to himself. when his deadly enemies were all standing before him defeated, having persecuted him and his followers, hunted them down for years, and were at his mercy after the city of mecca was taken back, he forgave every last one of them.it is true that muslims avoid depicting the prophet muhammed pbuh for fear that his image will be worshipped. he always reminded those around him that there was only one god, and that he himself was merely a man. he sought no personal glory and lived a very simple life. islam is a strictly monotheistic religion, and forbids the worship of idols in the strongest terms. it forbids anyone or anything to assign an equal partner with god. muslims do not, as a rule, paint pictures of the prophet, create statues of him, or depict him in the physical sense for fear he would be idolized.and because the messenger and the values he upheld are so dear to us, it does hurt deeply when he is insulted.and yet the irony is that in taking lives, those who claim to avenge the prophet s good name are assigning partners with god. for they value the reputation of the prophet above the value of a life given to all of us by god himself.those of us who enjoy satire know that it aims to ridicule, whilst giving us pause for thought. but those of us with half a brain cell are also aware, that if something offends us, we should avoid it, not draw attention to it. in a free society, we are not compelled to view satirical material if we do not enjoy it or find it funny. we are not really compelled to do anything, other than follow the laws of the land we live in.we can and do rely on scholars, historians and storytellers to ponder what the prophet himself would have made of the reaction to depictions and ridiculing of him. but we can also rely on common sense, which does not ask us to kill others in cold blood when we are offended. we can also rely on our hearts to tell us what we know about the character of the prophet muhammed, and look to the message that he brought. chapter 7 of the holy quran commands, hold to forgiveness, command what is right, and turn away from the ignorant. i suggest those claiming to follow the prophet and love him look within and ask themselves whether they follow in name only, and whether they have abandoned the actions that go with that devotion."

2015-01-07,Coaching in Canada: It's a dangerous game in the NHL,"looking for a high - paying job with months and months of paid free time consider a career as a canadian - based nhl head coach.from west to east, the landscape is littered with coaches getting paid not to coach a canadian club. over the past 12 months, five of the seven canadian teams have opted for the easiest and simplest form of organizational re - charge they fired the coach.the high turnover is an indictment of the performance of canadian - based teams in recent seasons. last spring, the montreal canadiens learned the loneliness of the long distance runner by being the only canadian team in the playoffs. an injury to starting goaltender carey price kept the habs from representing the eastern conference in the stanley cup final, but on balance this was a nice return to form after being stunned by a first - round exit at the hands of the ottawa senators in 2013.wither the rest while ottawa and the toronto maple leafs missed the mark in the east, vancouver, calgary and edmonton filled the bottom three rungs of the pacific division and winnipeg finished last in the central.happily, we can report that the canucks have rebounded smartly under new head coach willie desjardins, whose long apprenticeship in the college, junior and minor pro ranks flies in the face of the usual quick fix of old nhl reliables or young pro coaches.in winnipeg and calgary, where the jets and flames are having at it in the wild card chase, bob hartley, against all odds given the talent pool, earned an extension to carry on his good work while winnipeg made a good hire in paul maurice, always one of the game s most thoughtful bench men.for now, then, the canadian coaching carousel stops. at least until season s end. in this brief moment of tranquility, a glance back at the chronology of the bloodletting january 12, 2014, the jets fired claude noel, who was behind the bench when the jets came back to winnipeg in 2011. noel had been coach of the ahl manitoba moose, and when true north sports and entertainment , owners of the moose and the reborn jets a transfer of the altanta thrashers , noel was hired as a reward for services rendered. noel had his moments, usually with a crush of microphones in his face, but gave way to ex - carolina and toronto head coach maurice, who has the jets in the playoff hunt.on may 1, 2014, the canucks put john tortorella out of his misery after just one season coaching the canucks following the long reign of alain vigneault now doing a nice job with the new york rangers, torts old team . in vancouver, the lamentable torts era is best remembered for his dubious idea of getting the gifted sedin twins to become shot - blockers; and of course for the night he stormed the hallway in search of a fight with calgary flames head coach bob hartley. torts. generally obstinate, never dull.on december 8, 2014 the senators fired paul maclean after three - plus seasons. what a ride. maclean led the young senators to great heights a franchise - first playoff victory over an original six team, the canadiens in 2013 earning maclean a new contract and nhl coach of the year honours. a year later, the senators tumbled out of a playoff position and gm bryan murray said he pined for the old paul. maclean s farewell press conference was memorable you re the effing best, i love you paul, said a female fan bursting in on the conference, moments after maclean quoted a taylor swift verse . the last paul to stir such passion was a member of the beatles. under internal hire dave cameron, the senators have improved their shots on goal imbalance, but remain a playoff longshot.dysfunction thy name is oil. eight seasons of missing the playoffs and no end in sight. on december 15, one week after the maclean firing, the oilers dumped dallas eakins, the coach they lusted after when he was running the ahl toronto marlies from 2009 - 13. eakins followed a long list of coaches stuck with a flawed young lineup. in yet another bizarre set of media conferences, eakins and gm craig mactavish lavished each other with such praise we got fooled into thinking eakins was receiving an extension. interim head coach todd nelson, promoted from the ahl oklahoma city barons, has enjoyed some early success.like the senators, the leafs came within a whisker of dumping head coach randy carlyle last season. both maclean and carlyle were told by management to fall in line, and neither did. carlyle was stripped of his support system, having his assistants fired. the wonder is that he made it to the new year before being canned on tuesday, january 6. a strong start to the season bought some time. with a flawed core group of players, the leafs need to admit that coaching is down the list of problems with the organization. interim head coach peter horachek with the florida panthers last season , was behind the bench when the leafs played host to washington wednesday. long live the 67 champs.wscanlan ottawacitizen hockeyscanner"

2015-01-07,Four wine resolutions for 2015,"it s that time of year for a few wine resolutions. as none of them involves giving up wine, they should be enjoyable and a lot easier to keep than resolutions involving physical activity or weight loss although you could resolve to walk or jog to your local wine store, rather than drive, thereby keeping two resolutions at once.first, resolve to drink better wine this year. that doesn t necessarily spending more, because there are ranges of quality at every price point, but it might mean a bit of research into the relative merits of a number of wines. you could, too, spend more per bottle; to a point, there s a general tendency for more expensive wine to cost more. spending more per bottle doesn t mean you have to increase your wine budget just buy fewer bottles. some observers have noticed a trending to drink less but better in some countries, and this might be a more digestible way of reducing your wine consumption, too.second, drink outside your usual comfort zone. last i heard, the lcbo and vintages bring in some 7,000 products every year. they re not all in everyone s budget or to everyone s taste but, whatever you like in wine, there s plenty of choice. go to a country you don t usually check out or try a grape variety you don t know like the nebbiolo i review today . we generally work with a palette of 10 or 12 varieties, but you can treat your palate to the many others in the lcbo, vintages, and private wine stores.third, resolve to look through your basement, closets, and kitchen cabinets to see if you ve mislaid any bottles of wine. i recently heard from a reader with seven bottles of wine she had had for years, including some terrific italian wines from the 50s and 60s. some were leaking, others were just long past it. it s a bit like putting a good watercolour on a wall where it gets plenty of sunlight a real shame. if you unearth old bottles and aren t sure if the wine is likely to be drinkable, e - mail me.fourth, don t treat wine too seriously. it s made to be enjoyed, but many people seem to agonize over which wine goes with what food. good food, good wine, and good company are all you need for a good time. if your friends are appalled at your wine choices at a dinner party, don t look for different wines; get different friends.that said, i hope you all have a fabulous year that s punctuated with wine - finds. let me know if there are any topics you d like me to take on in these columns during 2015.this inexpensive and good value pinot grigio comes from the terre di chieti, near italy s adriatic coast. it delivers solid flavours that are consistent from start to finish, and clean, balanced acidity. drink it with poultry and pork dishes. 13 - per cent alcohol; 8.75 17483 this pinot noir, from an appellation near beaune in burgundy, is a good candidate for many roasted poultry and pork dishes. it offers concentrated flavours with complexity and definition, and clean, bright acidity. the tannins are easy - going. 13 - per cent alcohol; 23.95 325126 a big red from ontario s warm 2012 vintage, this is a very attractive blend of cabernet franc, merlot, and cabernet sauvignon. the fruit is concentrated, complex, and focused, and it s supported by clean acidity and framed by moderate tannins. drink it with red meats. 13.5 - per cent alcohol; 24.95 595002, vintages and wine rack stores from the langhe region of piedmont, in north - west italy, this is a full - flavoured red made from the nebbiolo grape variety. it s medium - full bodied, with deep, complex flavours, but it s well structured and balanced, and remarkably versatile. try it with a hearty red meat stew. 14 - per cent alcohol; 20.75 341156 "
